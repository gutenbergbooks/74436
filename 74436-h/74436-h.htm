<small>TIM’S FLIGHT.</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="cap">“Strayed.—A boy from the home of the subscriber; and
any one returning him will be suitably rewarded. Said
boy is about eleven years old, has short, light hair, a turned-up
nose, and face very much tanned. When last seen he had
on a suit of blue clothes considerably faded and worn, and
had with him a yellow dog, with a long body, short legs, and
a short tail. The boy answers to the name of Tim, and the
dog to that of Tip. Any information regarding the runaway
will be liberally paid for. Address Captain Rufus Babbige,
in care of this office.”</p>
</div>

<p>“There, Tim,” said the man who had been
reading the advertisement aloud from the
columns of a country newspaper to a very small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
boy, with large, dark eyes, and an exceedingly
dirty face, who was listening intently, “you see
that Rufe Babbige don’t intend to let you get
away as easy as you thought, for he’s willing to
pay something for any news of you, though I’ll
be bound he won’t part with very much money.”</p>

<p>“But he always said he wished I’d have sense
enough to die,” replied the boy, trying to choke
down the sob of terror which would rise in his
throat at the idea of being thus advertised for as
though he were a thief; “an’ it don’t seem to
me that there’s been a day but what he or Aunt
Betsey have given me a whippin’ since my
mother died. Look here!”</p>

<p>As he spoke the boy pushed the ragged coat
sleeves up from his thin arms, showing long discolorations
which had evidently been made by
a whip-lash.</p>

<p>“It’s all over me just like that, an’ I don’t see
what he wants Tip an’ me back for, ’cause he’s
always said he wished he was rid of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a shame to treat a boy that always behaved
himself as well as you did like that,”
said the proprietor of the country store into
which the runaway had entered to purchase a
couple of crackers, “an’ I don’t see what the
folks up in Selman were thinking of to let him
abuse you so. I don’t approve of boys running
away, but in your case I think the only fault
is that you didn’t run sooner.”</p>

<p>“But now that he’s put it in the paper he’ll be
sure to catch me, for I’m only six miles from
Selman;” and the big tears began to roll down
the boy’s cheeks, marking their course by the
clean lines they left on the dirty face.</p>

<p>“Anybody that knows him wouldn’t any more
think of sending you back to him than they
would of cutting your hand off,” said the man,
as he shook his fist savagely in the direction Captain
Babbige was supposed to be.</p>

<p>“But what does he want us for, when he’s always
wanted to get rid of us?” persisted the boy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
stooping down to caress a very queer-looking
dog, whose body seemed to have been stretched
out, and whose legs looked as if they had been
worn down by much running.</p>

<p>“I reckon I can tell you why he wants you,
Tim, and when you get older it’ll do you some
good to know it. He’s your uncle, an’ your legal
guardian, an’ I’ve been told by them that knows
that he’s got quite a sum of money belonging
to you, which would all be his if you should die.
Some day when you are of age you come back
here and claim it; but don’t you let him get hold
of you again now.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I won’t,” replied the boy, trembling
at the thought of the fate which would be his if
he should be so unlucky as to fall into the captain’s
clutches again.</p>

<p>“Run away from here so far that he can’t find
you, and when you get a place where you can go
to work be as good a boy as I’ve always known
you to be, and you’ll come out of this trouble by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
being a good, honest man. Here’s a couple of
dollars for you, and I only wish it was in my
power to take you home with me and keep you.
But Rufe Babbige would soon break that up, and
the best thing you can do is to trudge off as fast
as possible.”</p>

<p>The boy tried to thank the kind-hearted shopkeeper,
but the tears were coming so fast, and
the big sob in his throat had got so far up toward
his mouth, that he could not utter a word.</p>

<p>Just then a customer entered the store, and
he hurried away at once, closely followed by the
odd-looking dog, who displayed, in his way,
quite as much affection for the boy as the boy
did for him.</p>

<p>Down through the one street of the little village,
out on to the country road, the two walked
as if they were already foot-sore and weary; and
when at last they came to where the road wound
along through the woods Tim sat down on a rock
to rest, while Tip huddled up close beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>“It’s kinder too bad to be called such names
in the papers, ain’t it, Tip?” said the boy, speaking
for the first time since they had left the store,
“an’ I think he ought to be ’shamed of hisself to
talk so about you. It ain’t your fault if your legs
is short an’ your tail gone; you’re worth more’n
all the dogs in this world, an’ you’re all that I’ve
got to love me, an’ we’ll never go back to let
Captain Babbige beat us any more, will we,
Tip?”</p>

<p>Just then the dog, which had been chewing
some blades of grass, got one in his nose, a mishap
which caused him to sneeze and shake his
head vigorously; while Tim, who firmly believed
that Tip understood all that was said to
him, looked upon this as a token that the dog
agreed to what he had said, and he continued,
earnestly:</p>

<p>“I know just as well as you do, Tip, that it
wasn’t right for us to run away, but how could
we help it? They kept tellin’ us we was in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
way an’ they wished we’d die, and everybody
that was kind to us told us we’d better do just
what we have done. Now we’re off in the big,
wide world all by ourselves, Tip, an’ whether
the cap’en catches us or not, you’ll love me just
as much as you always have, won’t you, for
you’re all I’ve got that cares for me?”</p>

<p>The dog was still busy trying to settle the
question about the grass in his nose, and after
that was decided in his favor he looked up at
his young master and barked several times, as if
expressing his opinion about something, which
the boy interpreted as advice.</p>

<p>“Well, I s’pose you’re right, Tip—we had
ought to go along, for if we don’t we sha’n’t even
find a barn to sleep in, as we did last night.”</p>

<p>As he spoke Tim arose wearily from his hard
seat, his legs stiff from long walking, and
trudged along, while Tip followed as closely at
his heels as it was possible for him to get.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>It was nearly sunset, and as he walked on it
seemed as if he was getting farther into the
woods, instead of coming out at some place where
he could find shelter for the night.</p>

<p>“Looks kinder lonesome, don’t it, Tip?” and
Tim choked back a sob as he spoke. “I don’t
want to sleep out here in the woods if I can help
it; but it wouldn’t be half so bad if one of us
was alone, would it?”</p>

<p>In this fashion, keeping up a sort of a conversation—if
it could be called such where one did
all the talking and the other wagged his short
stump of a tail—the two journeyed on until it
was almost too dark to distinguish objects a short
distance ahead.</p>

<p>Only once since the store-keeper had given
him the two dollars had Tim thought of what he
had said regarding Captain Babbige’s having
money of his, and then he put it out of his mind
as an impossibility, for surely, he thought, he
would not have scolded so about what he and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
dog ate if Tim had had any property of his
own.</p>

<p>“I guess we shall have to sleep in the woods,
Tip,” said Tim, disconsolately, as the trees appeared
to be less thick together, but yet no signs
of a house; “but it won’t be much worse than
what Aunt Betsey calls a bed good enough for
boys like me.”</p>

<p>Just at that instant Tim was frightened out
of nearly all his senses, and Tip started on a
barking match that threatened to shake his poor
apology of a tail from his thin body, by hearing
a shrill voice cry out:</p>

<p>“Look here, feller, where are you goin’ this
time of night?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_II"><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span><br>
<small>SAM, THE FAT BOY.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Tim stopped as quickly as if he had stepped
into a pool of glue which had suddenly
hardened, holding him prisoner, and peered anxiously
ahead, trying to discover where the voice
came from.</p>

<p>“Didn’t know there was anybody ’round here,
did yer?” continued the voice, while the body
still remained hidden from view.</p>

<p>Again Tim tried to discover the speaker, and,
failing in the attempt, he asked, in a sort of
frightened desperation, “Who are you, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Call off yer dog, an’ I’ll show yer.”</p>

<p>These words made Tim feel very much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
braver, for they showed that the speaker as well
as himself was frightened, and he lost no time
in reducing Tip to a state of subjection by clasping
him firmly around the neck.</p>

<p>“Now come out; he wouldn’t hurt a fly, an’ it’s
only his way to bark when he’s kinder scared.”</p>

<p>Thus urged, the party afraid of the dog came
out of his place of hiding, which was none other
than the branches of a tree, by simply dropping
to the ground—a proceeding which gave
another shock to the nerves of both Tim and
Tip.</p>

<p>But there was nothing about him very alarming,
and when Tim had a full view of him, he
was inclined to be angry with himself for having
allowed so short a boy to frighten him. He was
no taller than Tim and, as near as could be seen
in the dim light, about as broad as he was long—a
perfect ball of jelly, with a face, two legs, and
two arms carved on it.</p>

<p>It was impossible to gain a good view of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
face, but that did not trouble Tim, who was only
anxious to learn who this boy was, and whether
he might be sufficiently acquainted with Captain
Babbige to send him news of the runaway.</p>

<p>The new-comer did not appear to be in any
hurry to begin the conversation, but stood, with
his hands in his pockets, eying Tim as though he
was some strange animal who might be expected
to cut up queer antics at any moment.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said Tim, after he thought the fat
boy had looked at him quite as long as was
necessary.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“Outer that tree there,” replied the boy,
bravely, as he pointed to the place where he had
been hiding.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw you come out of there; but that
ain’t where you live, is it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Where do you live?” And Tim was beginning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
to think that it required a great deal of
labor to extract a small amount of knowledge
from this fat party.</p>

<p>“Oh, I live over the hill, about half a mile
down the road. Got anything good to eat?”</p>

<p>The question seemed so unnecessary and out
of place, considering all the circumstances, that
Tim took no notice of it, but asked, “What’s
your name?”</p>

<p>“Sam.”</p>

<p>“Sam what?”</p>

<p>“I dunno, but I guess it’s Simpson.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re funny if you ain’t sure what your
name is,” said Tim, thoughtfully, forgetting his
own troubles in his curiosity about this queer
specimen. “What makes you think your name’s
Simpson?”</p>

<p>“’Cause that’s my father’s name.”</p>

<p>By this time Tim had released his hold of
Tip’s neck, and the dog walked around Sam on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
sort of smelling tour, very much to the boy’s
discomfort.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said Tim, “he won’t bite
you. He’s the best and quietest dog in the world
if you only let him alone.”</p>

<p>“I’ll let him alone,” replied Sam, still in doubt
as to Tip’s good intentions. “I’ll let him alone,
an’ I wish he’d let me alone.”</p>

<p>“He’s only kinder gettin’ acquainted, that’s all.
Say, do you s’pose your father would let me sleep
in his barn to-night?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. What do you want to for?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I ain’t got any other place.”</p>

<p>If Sam hadn’t been so fat he would probably
have started in surprise; but as it was he expressed
his astonishment by a kind of grunt, and,
going nearer to Tim, he asked, “Where do you
live?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere. Me an’ Tip are tryin’ to find some
place where we can earn our own livin’,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Tim, in doubt as to whether he ought to tell this
boy his whole story or not.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you got any father or mother?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the sad reply. “They’re both dead,
an’ me an’ Tip have to look out for ourselves.
We did live with Captain Babbige, but we
couldn’t stand it any longer, an’ so we started out
on our own hook.”</p>

<p>“Where do you get things to eat?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got some money to buy ’em with.”</p>

<p>“How much have you got?”</p>

<p>“I had two cents when I left Selman, an’ Mr.
Sullivan, that keeps a store down to the mills,
gave me two dollars.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what let’s do,” said Sam, eagerly,
as his eyes sparkled with delight. “Jest the other
side of my house there’s a store, an’ we can go
down there an’ get two big sticks of candy, an’
have an awful good time.”</p>

<p>Tim reflected a moment. He knew that he
ought to keep his money; but Sam’s idea seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
such a good one that the thought of the pleasure
which would come with the eating of the candy
was too much for his notions of economy; therefore
he compromised by saying, “I will, if you’ll
let me sleep in your barn.”</p>

<p>Sam quickly agreed to that—in order to get
the candy he would probably have promised to
give the entire farm away—and the three—Sam,
Tim and Tip—started off, the best of friends.</p>

<p>But before they had gone very far Sam
stopped in the middle of the road, saying, mournfully,
“My! but I forgot all about the cow!”</p>

<p>“What cow?”</p>

<p>“Father sent me down here to find old Whiteface,
an’ I forgot all about her when I saw you.”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you find her now? Me an’
Tip will help you.”</p>

<p>“But it’ll take so long, an’ before we get back
the store will be shut up,” objected Sam, who
stood undecided in the road, as if he had half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
a mind to leave old Whiteface to her fate while
he made sure of the candy.</p>

<p>“Never mind if the store is shut up,” said Tim,
earnestly. “We can get the candy just as well in
the morning, an’ perhaps we’ll find her so quick
that there’ll be plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“Will you buy the candy in the mornin’ if you
don’t to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will, honest.”</p>

<p>“Cross your throat.”</p>

<p>Tim went through the ceremony of crossing
his throat to make his promise more solemn, and
search was made for the cow.</p>

<p>Up to this time it was plain that Sam did not
feel any great amount of love for or confidence
in Tip; but when, after a few moments’ search,
his loud bark told that he had discovered the
missing cow, his future was assured, so far as
Sam Simpson was concerned.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s somethin’ like,” he said, after
they had started homeward. “When you’ve got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
such a dog as that, all a feller’s got to do is to
set down an’ send him after ’em. It’s the awfullest
hateful thing in the world to go off huntin’
cows when you don’t want to.”</p>

<p>Tim had many and serious doubts as to
whether Tip could be depended on to go for the
cows alone; but he did not think it best to put
those doubts in words, lest he should deprive his
pet of his new-found friend.</p>

<p>It was only a ten minutes’ walk to Sam’s home,
and when the cow had been led to her stall Tim
proposed that Sam should ask permission for
him to sleep in the barn.</p>

<p>“There’s time enough for that when we come
back,” was Sam’s reply, the thought of the candy
he was to have in case they reached the store before
it was closed for the night driving all else
from his mind. “Come on; we’ll catch Mr. Coburn
if we hurry.”</p>

<p>Now, Tim would much rather have had the
question settled as to his sleeping quarters before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
starting out for pleasure; but Sam was so
eager for the promised feast that he felt obliged
to do as he said, more especially since it was
through his influence that he hoped to receive
the favor.</p>

<p>Naturally Sam Simpson was not a quick-motioned
boy; but no one could have complained
of the speed with which he went toward Mr.
Coburn’s store that night, and Tim found it hard
work to keep pace with him.</p>

<p>The store was open, but the proprietor was
just making preparations for closing. The candy,
placed in two rather dirty glass jars, was in its
accustomed place, and beamed down upon them
in all its sticky sweetness, delighting Sam simply
by the view to such an extent that he could hardly
keep his two feet upon the floor.</p>

<p>With a gravity befitting the occasion and the
amount of wealth he was about to squander, Tim
asked to be allowed to see the goods he proposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
to buy, in order to make sure they were of the
proper length.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Coburn rubbed his glasses carefully,
wiped his face as a sort of preface to his task,
and set about making this last sale of the day
with the air of a man who knows he is called
upon to deal with very exacting customers.</p>

<p>It was fully five minutes before Tim could
settle the weighty question of whether it was
better to buy a stick of peppermint and one of
lemon, and thus by dividing them get two distinct
treats, or to take both of one kind, and thus
prevent any dispute as to whether he had made
a just and equal division.</p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="i_fp020">
  <img src="images/i_fp020.jpg" alt="" title="">
  <figcaption class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_20">“PEPPERMINT OR LEMON?”</a></p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While this struggle was going on in the purchaser’s
mind Sam fidgeted around, standing
first on one foot and then on the other, watching
every movement Tim made, while Tip searched
over every portion of the store, very much to
Mr. Coburn’s annoyance.</p>

<p>The decision was finally made, but not before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Mr. Coburn hinted that he could not afford to
burn a quart of oil in order that his customers
might see how to spend two cents, and, with a
peppermint stick in one hand and a lemon stick
in the other, Tim left the store, followed by Sam
and preceded by Tip.</p>

<p>To make a fair division of the sweet feast was
quite as great a task as the purchase had been,
and it was begun in the gravest manner.</p>

<p>The two sticks were carefully measured, and
by the aid of Sam’s half-bladed jack-knife,
broken at the proper place. A large rock by the
side of the road served as a seat, and there the
two boys munched away as slowly as possible, in
order that the feast might be prolonged to the
utmost.</p>

<p>Tip sat close by, watching every mouthful in
a hungry way, but refusing the portion Tim offered
him.</p>

<p>Now that the feast was fast fading away into
only a remembrance, the thought of where he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
was to spend the night began to trouble Tim
again, and he asked, anxiously, “Sure your father
will let me sleep in the barn?”</p>

<p>Before the candy had been purchased the fat
boy had been perfectly sure Tim could sleep in
his father’s barn; but now that the dainty was in
his possession he began to have some doubts on
the subject.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we’ll do,” he said, his
mouth so full of candy that Tim could hardly
understand him. “Father an’ mother will be in
bed when we get home, an’ it won’t be any use
to bother ’em. You come right up-stairs to bed
with me, an’ we’ll fix it in the morning.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather ask them, an’ sleep in the barn,”
said Tim, not half liking this plan.</p>

<p>“But they’ll be asleep, an’ you can’t,” was the
quiet reply.</p>

<p>“Then I’d rather go in the barn anyway.”</p>

<p>“Now see here,” said Sam, with an air of wisdom,
as he sucked the remaining particles of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
candy from his fingers, “I know father an’
mother better’n you do, don’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Tim, glad that Sam had made
one statement with which he could agree.</p>

<p>“Then you do jest as I tell you. We’ll creep
up-stairs like a couple of mice, an’ in the morning
I’ll fix everything. Mother wouldn’t want
you to sleep in the barn when you could come
with me as well as not; an’ you do as I tell you.”</p>

<p>It did not seem to Tim that he could do anything
else, and he said, as he slid down from
the rock, “I’ll do it, Sam, but I rather you’d
ask them.”</p>

<p>Sam, content with having gained his point,
walked silently along, with Tim by his side, and
followed by Tip, who acted as if he knew he was
going out to spend the night without a proper
invitation.</p>

<p>When they reached the house not a light was
to be seen, and the three crept up-stairs, not quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
as softly as mice, but so quietly that Mr. and
Mrs. Simpson did not hear them.</p>

<p>That night Sam, Tim, and Tip lay on one
bed, and neither one of them lost any sleep by
thinking of their possible reception in the
morning.</p>

<small>TIP’S INTRODUCTION TO MRS. SIMPSON.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On the following morning Tim and Sam
were awakened very suddenly by a confused
noise, which appeared to come from the
kitchen below, and which could not have been
greater had a party of boys been engaged in a
game of leap-frog there.</p>

<p>A woman’s screams were heard amid the
crashing of furniture as it was overturned, the
breaking of crockery, and the sounds of scurryings
to and fro, while high above all came, at
irregular intervals, the yelp of a dog.</p>

<p>This last sound caused Tim the greatest fear.
A hasty glance around the room had shown him
that Tip, who had been peacefully curled up on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the outside of the bed when he last remembered
anything, was no longer to be seen, and, without
knowing how it could have happened, he
was sure it was none other than his pet who was
uttering those cries of distress.</p>

<p>In a few moments more he learned that he
was not mistaken, for Tip rushed into the room,
his tongue hanging out, his stub of a tail sticking
straight up, and looking generally as though
he had been having a hard time of it.</p>

<p>Before Tim, who had at once leaped out of
bed, could comfort his pet, a voice, sounding
as if its owner was sadly out of breath, was heard
crying, “Sam! Sam! Sammy!”</p>

<p>“What, marm?” replied Sam, who lay quaking
with fear, and repenting the fact that his desire
for candy had led him into what looked
very much like a bad scrape.</p>

<p>“Did a dog just come into your room?”</p>

<p>“Yes, marm.”</p>

<p>“Throw something at him and drive him out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>For an instant Sam clutched the pillow as if he
would obey the command; but Tim had his arms
around Tip’s neck, ready to save him from any
injury, even if he was obliged to suffer himself.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you drive him out?” cried Mrs.
Simpson, after she had vainly waited to hear the
sound of her son’s battle with the animal.</p>

<p>“Why—why—why—” stammered Sam, at a
loss to know what to say, and trembling with
fear.</p>

<p>“Are you afraid of him?”</p>

<p>“No, marm,” was the faltering reply.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you do as I tell you?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, Tim won’t let me,” cried Sam,
now so frightened that he hardly knew what he
did say.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter with the boy?” Tim
heard the good woman say; and then the sound
of rapid footsteps on the stairs told that she was
coming to make a personal investigation.</p>

<p>Sam, in a tremor of fear, rolled over on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
face and buried his head in the pillow, as if by
such a course he could shelter himself from the
storm he expected was about to break upon him.</p>

<p>Tim was crouching in the middle of the floor,
his face close down to Tip’s nose, and his arms
clasped so tightly around the dog’s neck that it
seemed as if he would choke him.</p>

<p>That was the scene Mrs. Simpson looked in
upon after she had been nearly frightened out of
her senses by a strange dog while she was cooking
breakfast. She had tried to turn the intruder
out-of-doors; but he, thinking she wanted
to play with him, had acted in such a strange and
at the same time familiar manner, that she had
become afraid, and the confusion which had
awakened the boys had been caused by both,
when neither knew exactly what to do.</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson stood at the room door looking
in fully half a minute before she could speak,
and then she asked, “What is the meaning of this,
Samuel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>Sam made no reply, but buried his face deeper
in the pillows, while the ominous shaking of his
fat body told that he was getting ready to cry
in advance of the whipping he expected to
receive.</p>

<p>“Who is this boy?” asked the lady, finding
that her first question was likely to receive no
reply.</p>

<p>Sam made no sign of life, and Tim, knowing
that something must be said at once, replied piteously,
“Please, ma’am, it’s only me an’ Tip.”</p>

<p>Sam’s face was still buried in the pillows; but
the trembling had ceased, as if he was anxious to
learn whether his companion could extricate
himself from the position into which he had
been led.</p>

<p>“Who are you, and how did you come here?”
asked Mrs. Simpson, wonderingly.</p>

<p>Tim turned toward the bed, as if he expected
Sam would answer that question; but that young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
man made no sign that he had even heard it, and
Tim was obliged to tell the story.</p>

<p>“I’m only Tim Babbige, an’ this is Tip. We
was tryin’ to find a place to sleep last night, when
we met Sam, an’ after we’d found the cow we
went down to the store an’ bought some candy,
an’ when we come back Sam was goin’ to ask you
to let me sleep in the barn, but you was in bed;
so he said it was all right for me to come up here
an’ sleep with him. I’m awful sorry I did it, an’
sorry Tip acted so bad; but if you won’t scold
we’ll go right straight away.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson was by no means a hard-hearted
woman, and the boy’s explanation, as well as his
piteous way of making it, caused her to feel
kindly disposed toward him. She asked him
about himself; and by the time he had finished
telling of the death of his parents, the cruel treatment
he had received from Captain and Mrs.
Babbige, and of his desperate attempt at bettering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
his condition, her womanly heart had a
great deal of sympathy in it for him.</p>

<p>Then Tim added, as if it was the last of his
pitiful story, “Me an’ Tip ain’t got anybody who
cares for us but each other, an’ if we don’t get
a chance to work, so’s we can get some place to
live, I don’t know what we will do.” Then he
laid his head on the dog’s nose, and cried as
though his little heart were breaking, while Tip
set up a series of most doleful howls.</p>

<p>“You poor child,” said the good woman,
kindly, “you’re not large enough to work for
your living, and I don’t know what Mr. Simpson
will say to your being here very long; but
you shall stay till we see what can be done for
you, whatever he says. Now, don’t cry any more,
but dress yourself, and come down-stairs and
help me clean up the litter the dog and I made.
Sam, you lazy boy,” she added, as she turned
toward her half-concealed son, “get up and dress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
yourself. You ought to be ashamed for not telling
me last night what you were about.”</p>

<p>Then, patting Tim on the head, the good
woman went down-stairs to attend to her household
duties.</p>

<p>As soon as the sound of the closing door told
that his mother had left the room Sam rolled out
of bed, much as a duck gets out of her nest, and
said triumphantly to Tim, who was busy dressing,
“Well, we got out of that scrape all right,
didn’t we?”</p>

<p>Tim looked up at him reproachfully, remembering
Sam’s silence when the affair looked so
dark; but he contented himself with simply saying,
“Yes, it’s all right till we see what your
father will say about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he won’t say anything so long as mother
don’t,” was the confident reply; and the conversation
was ended by Tim going down-stairs to
help Mrs. Simpson in repairing the damage done
by Tip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Before he had been helping her very long he
showed himself so apt at such work that she
asked, “How does it happen that you are so
handy at such things?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Tim, bashfully, “’cept
that Aunt Betsey always made me help her in
the kitchen, an’ I s’pose it comes handy for a
feller to do what he must do.”</p>

<p>By the time Sam came down-stairs the kitchen
presented its usual neat appearance, and he was
disposed to make light of his mother’s fright;
but she soon changed his joy to grief by telling
him to go to the spring for a pail of water.</p>

<p>Now, if there was one thing more than another
which Sam disliked to do, it was to bring
water from the spring. The distance was long,
and he believed it was unhealthy for him to lift
as much weight as that contained in a ten-quart
pail of water. As usual, he began to make a
variety of excuses, chief among which was the
one that the water brought the night before was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
as cool and fresh as any that could be found in
the spring.</p>

<p>Tim, anxious to make himself useful in any
way, offered to go, and then Sam was perfectly
willing to point out the spring, and to generally
superintend the job.</p>

<p>“Tim may go to help you,” said Mrs. Simpson,
“but you are not to let him do all the work.”</p>

<p>Sam muttered something which his mother
understood to mean that he would obey her, and
the boys left the house, going through the grove
of pine-trees that bordered a little pond, at one
side of which, sunk deep in the earth, was a
hogshead, into which the water bubbled and
flowed from its bed under the ground.</p>

<p>But Sam was far more interested in pointing
out objects of interest to himself than in leading
the way to the spring. He showed Tim the very
hole where he had captured a woodchuck alive,
called his attention to a tree in which he was
morally certain a family of squirrels had their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
home, and enlarged upon the merits of certain
kinds of traps best calculated to deceive the
bushy-tailed beauties.</p>

<p>Tim did not fancy this idea of idling when
there was work to be done; and as soon as he
saw the spring he hurried off, in the middle of
a story Sam was telling about a rabbit he caught
the previous winter.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of bein’ in such a rush?”
asked Sam, as, obliged to end his story, he ran
after Tim. “Mother don’t want the water till
breakfast’s ready, an’ that won’t be for a good
while yet. Jest come over on this side the pond,
an’ I’ll show you the biggest frog you ever saw
in your life; that is, if he’s got out of bed yet.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get the water first, an’ then we can come
back an’ see everything,” said Tim, as he hurried
on.</p>

<p>“But jest come down here a minute while I
see if I can poke him out of his hole,” urged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Sam, as he picked up a stick and started for the
frog’s home.</p>

<p>Tim paid no attention to him; he had been sent
for water, and he did not intend to waste any
time until that work had been done. He leaned
over the side of the hogshead to lower the pail
in, when Sam shouted, “Come here; I’ve found
him!”</p>

<p>But Tim went on with his work; and just as
he had filled the pail, and was drawing it up,
he heard a cry of fear, accompanied by a furious
splashing, which he knew could not come from
a frog, however large he might be.</p>

<p>Dropping his pail, at the risk of having it sink
beyond his reach, he looked up just in time to
see a pair of very fat legs sticking above the
water at that point where the frog was supposed
to reside, and to hear a gurgling sound, as if
the owner of the legs was strangling.</p>

<p>For a single moment Tim was at a loss to account
for the disappearance of Sam, and the sudden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
appearance of those legs; but by seeing Tip
run toward the spot, barking furiously, and by
seeing the stick which was to have disturbed the
frog in his morning nap floating on the water,
he understood that Sam had fallen into the pond,
without having had half so much fun with the
frog as he expected.</p>

<p>Tim, now thoroughly frightened, ran quickly
toward his unfortunate companion, calling
loudly for help.</p>

<p>When he reached the bank from which Sam
had slipped the legs were still sticking straight
up in the air, showing that their owner’s head
had stuck fast in the mud. By holding on to
the bushes with one hand, and stretching out the
other, he succeeded in getting hold of Sam’s
trousers, at which he struggled and pulled with
all his strength. Although it could hardly be
expected that so slight a boy as Tim could do
very much toward handling so heavy a body as
Sam’s, he did succeed in freeing him from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
mud, and in pulling him to the surface of the
water.</p>

<p>After nearly five minutes of hard work, during
which Tip did all he could to help, Tim
succeeded in pulling the fat boy into more shallow
water, where he managed to get on to his
feet again.</p>

<p>A mournful-looking picture he made as he
stood on the bank, with the water running from
every point of his clothing, while the black mud
in which he had been stuck formed a cap for his
head, and portions of it ran down over his face,
striping him as decidedly as ever fancy painted
an Indian.</p>

<p>He was a perfect picture of fat, woe, and dirt,
and if he had not been in such peril a few moments
before Tim would have laughed outright.</p>

<p>He was evidently trying to say something, for
he kept gasping for breath, and each time he
opened his mouth it was filled with the mud and
water that ran from his hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Tim, anxiously.
“Art you hurt much?”</p>

<p>“No—no,” gasped Sam; “but—but I saw the
frog.”</p>

<p>This time Tim did not try to restrain his
mirth; and when Mrs. Simpson, who had been
startled by Tim’s cries for help, arrived on the
spot, she found nothing very alarming. Master
Sam received a severe shaking, and was led away
to be cleaned while Tim and Tip were left to
attend to the work of bringing the water.</p>

<p>At breakfast—where Sam ate so heartily that
it was evident he had not been injured by his
bath—the question of what should be done about
allowing Tim to remain was discussed by Mr.
and Mrs. Simpson.</p>

<p>The farmer said that a boy as small as he
could not earn his salt, and it would be better
for him to try to find a family who had no boys
of their own, or go back to Captain Babbige,
where he belonged. He argued, while Tim listened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
in fear, that it was wrong to encourage
boys to run away from their lawful protectors,
and was inclined to make light of the suffering
Tim had told about.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the runaway, Mrs. Simpson
believed his story entirely, and would not listen
to any proposition to send him back to Selman.
The result of the matter was that Mr. Simpson
agreed to allow him to remain there a few days,
but with the distinct understanding that his stay
must be short.</p>

<p>This was even more than the homeless boy had
expected, and he appeared so thankful and delighted
at the unwilling consent that the farmer
began to think perhaps there was more in him
than appeared on the surface, although he still
remained firm in his decision that he must leave
the farm as soon as possible.</p>

<small>TIM’S START IN LIFE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">During the first day of Tim’s stay at the
Simpson farm he was careful to help in
every kind of work, and many were the praises
he won from Mrs. Simpson, who held him up
as an example to Sam until that young man almost
felt sorry he had brought him there.</p>

<p>At night Tim went with Sam for the cow, and
here it was that Tip made a most miserable failure,
so far as showing that he was a valuable
dog was concerned.</p>

<p>Sam, remembering how easily the dog had
found the cow the night before, wanted to wait
by the bars and let Tip go in and bring her out,
and Tim was obliged to tell him that his pet had
not been trained to do that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>Then Sam put on an injured air, as if his mistake
had come from something Tim had said,
rather than being an idea from his own rather
thick head.</p>

<p>That night the boys and the dog went again
to Mr. Coburn’s store; not because Tim proposed
to spend any of his two dollars, but because there
was a great fascination about the place for Sam.
He delighted to lounge around there, at a time
when he ought to have been in bed, listening to
the conversation of older loafers, believing he
was gaining wisdom and an insight into the ways
of the world at the same time.</p>

<p>On that particular night there were not so
many of the noble army of loafers present as
usual, and the conversation was so dull that Mr.
Coburn found plenty of time to question Tim as
to every little particular about himself.</p>

<p>Tim saw no reason why he should gratify the
store-keeper’s curiosity, and perhaps let some
one know his story who would think it his duty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
to send information to Captain Babbige, so he
contented himself by simply saying that he had
come there in the hope of getting some work
to do.</p>

<p>“Want to work, do yer?” asked a stout man,
with a very red face and gruff voice, who had
been listening to the conversation.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Tim, a trifle awed by the
gruffness of the voice.</p>

<p>“What can you do?” and the red-faced man
now turned to have a better view.</p>

<p>“’Most anything, sir.”</p>

<p>“Where are yer folks?”</p>

<p>“My father an’ mother are dead,” said Tim,
sadly, as he stooped to pat Tip’s head in a loving
way.</p>

<p>“Well, now, see here,” and the man took Tim
by the arm, as if he was about to examine his
muscle: “I’m the captain of a steamboat that
runs out of the city, and I want just such a boy
as you are to work ’round at anything. I’ll give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
you three dollars a month and find you. What
do you say to it? Will you come?”</p>

<p>Tim was not exactly certain what the gruff-voiced
man meant when he said he would pay
him so much money and “find him,” and he hesitated
about answering until he could understand
it.</p>

<p>Mr. Coburn thought it was the wages that
prevented a speedy acceptance of the brilliant
offer, and he hastened to show his friendliness to
the captain by saying:</p>

<p>“Such offers as them don’t grow on every bush,
sonny, an’ you had better take it. I’ve known
Captain Pratt a good many years, an’ I know
he will treat you just as if he was your father.
Three dollars is a good deal of money for a little
shaver like you.”</p>

<p>Tim looked at Sam for a moment doubtfully,
and then he thought of what Mr. Simpson had
said about his remaining at the farm.</p>

<p>“Can I take Tip with me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, that’s your dog, is it? He hain’t a very
handsome one; but I suppose you can find a
chance for him somewhere on the boat—yes, you
can take him.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>“All right. I shall start from this store to-morrow
morning at ten o’clock. Will you be
here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Tim, and then he beckoned
Sam to go out. He had made up his mind suddenly,
and now that it was too late to draw back
he wanted to talk the matter over, and hear what
Sam had to say about it.</p>

<p>There was no need for him to have feared that
Sam did not look with favor upon the plan, for
before they were out of sight of the loungers in
the store that young man burst out in an envious
tone:</p>

<p>“Well, you are the awfullest luckiest feller I
ever heard of! Here you’ve gone an’ got a chance
to run a steamboat, where you won’t have anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
to do but jest sail ’round wherever you
want to. I wish it was me that was going.”</p>

<p>If Tim had been in doubt before as to the
wisdom of the step he was about to take, he
was perfectly satisfied now that Sam was so delighted
with it, and he began to think that perhaps
he had been fortunate.</p>

<p>Mr. Simpson did not seem to think the opening
in life which had been so suddenly discovered
for Tim was so very brilliant, and Mrs.
Simpson actually looked as if she felt sorry.
But, as neither of them made any objection to
it, or offered the boy a home with them, there
was nothing to prevent him from carrying out
the agreement he had made.</p>

<p>At a very early hour on the following morning
Tim was up and dressed. Sam’s glowing
pictures of the happy life he was about to lead
had so excited him that he was anxious to begin
it at once, and his sleep had been troubled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
by dreams of life on a steamboat under all kinds
of possible and impossible circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. Simpson gave him twenty-five cents as a
nest-egg to the fortune he was about to make;
and when Mrs. Simpson packed a generous
lunch for him he choked up so badly that it was
only with the greatest difficulty he could thank
her for her kindness.</p>

<p>“Be a good boy, and never do anything to be
ashamed of,” was the good lady’s parting charge,
and he answered:</p>

<p>“I’ll try hard, so’s you sha’n’t be sorry you was
so good to me.”</p>

<p>Sam walked toward the store with him, while
as lonely and envious a feeling as he ever knew
came over him as he thought of all the things
Tim would see, simply because he had neither
home nor parents, while he, who had both, was
obliged to remain where he could see nothing.</p>

<p>“I wish it was me that was goin’,” he said,
with a sigh of envy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“If I had as good a home as you’ve got I
wouldn’t want to go away,” replied Tim,
gravely; and yet Sam had talked so much about
the charms of the life he was so soon to lead
that he had already begun to look upon himself
as a very fortunate boy, and was impatient
to begin his work at once.</p>

<p>The walk to Mr. Coburn’s store was not a
long one; and although they were there fully
half an hour before the time agreed upon, they
found Captain Pratt ready and waiting for them.
In fact, it seemed almost as if he feared his new
boy, however unimportant the position he was
to occupy, would not keep the agreement he had
made.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you on hand early, for it’s
a good sign,” and the captain’s face was wreathed
in what he intended should be a pleasing smile,
but which really was an ugly grimace.</p>

<p>Tim hardly knew what reply to make, for that
smile caused him to feel very uncomfortable;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
but he managed to say that he would always try
to be on time, and the captain, in the excess of
his good nature, gave him such a forcibly
friendly slap on the shoulder that his teeth
chattered.</p>

<p>In order to reach the city from the four corners
where Mr. Pratt lived it was necessary to
ride four miles in a carriage, and then take the
steam cars.</p>

<p>An open wagon was the mode of conveyance;
and as the driver was quite large, while Captain
Pratt was no small party, there was no other
way for Tim to ride save curled up in the end,
where he could keep a lookout for Tip, who
was, of course, to follow on behind as fast as
his short legs would permit.</p>

<p>When everything was ready for the start, and
Captain Pratt was making some final business
arrangements with Mr. Coburn, Sam bade Tim
good-bye.</p>

<p>“You’re awful lucky,” he said, as he clambered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
up on the wagon, where he could whisper in his
friend’s ear; “an’ if you see any place for me
on the steamer, send word right up—you can
tie a note on Tip’s collar an’ send him up with
it—an’ I’ll come right down.”</p>

<p>Sam would have said more, but the horse
started; he nearly tumbled from his perch, and
Tim’s journey to the city had begun.</p>

<p>It seemed to Tim that Captain Pratt changed
as soon as they started. Instead of keeping up
the idea of fatherly benevolence, which he had
seemed to be full to running over with, he spoke
sharply, and did not try to avoid hurting the
boy’s feelings.</p>

<p>If, when the wagon jolted over the rough road,
the boy’s head came in contact with his arm,
which was thrown across the back of the seat,
he would tell him to keep down where he belonged;
and if he heard Tim’s heels knocking
against the axle, he would scold him for not
holding them up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>Between this sudden change in the kind captain’s
ways and his fear that Tip would not be
able to keep up with the wagon, Tim was feeling
rather sad when the depot was reached.</p>

<p>During the ride on the cars Captain Pratt
took very little notice of Tim, and when they
arrived at the depot he simply said:</p>

<p>“Here boy, go down to Pier 43, and tell the
steward of the <i>Pride of the Wave</i> that I’ve hired
you, and get to work.”</p>

<p>Tim had no more idea of where Pier 43 was
than he had of the location of the Cannibal
Islands, but he started out with a great show
of pluck, yet with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>With Tip following close at his heels, Tim
walked some distance without seeing either
wharves or water, and then he inquired the way.</p>

<p>The first gentleman to whom he spoke was a
stranger in the city, and knew no more about it
than he did; the second directed him in such
a confusing way that he went almost opposite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
to where he should have gone; but the third one
gave him the directions so clearly that he had
no farther trouble in reaching the desired place.</p>

<p>The <i>Pride of the Wave</i> was not a large boat,
and to any one accustomed to steamers would
have seemed very shabby; but to Tim she appeared
like a veritable floating palace, and it
was some time before he dared to venture on
board of her.</p>

<p>Finally he saw one of the deck hands, who,
despite his dirty clothes, did not appear to be
awed by the magnificence of the boat, and Tim
asked him where he should find the steward.</p>

<p>The man told him to go below, and, with Tip
still close at his heels, he went down the brass-covered
stairs to the cabin, which was lined
with berths on either side, wondering at all he
saw, until he almost forgot why he was there.</p>

<p>He was soon startled out of this state of wonderment,
however, by hearing a gruff voice
shout:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“Now, then, youngster, what do <em>you</em> want?”</p>

<p>“I want to see the steward,” replied Tim, in
a voice which could hardly be heard.</p>

<p>“I’m the steward. Now what else do you
want?” replied the party who had spoken first,
and who was a little, old, rather pleasant-faced
man, with a voice about six sizes too large for
his body.</p>

<p>Tim repeated the captain’s words as nearly as
he could remember them, and the steward looked
him over carefully, with just the faintest show
of pity on his face.</p>

<p>“You don’t look as if you’d stand it very long
to work for the captain of this boat; but that’s
none of my business. Whose dog is that?”</p>

<p>“That’s Tip: he’s mine.”</p>

<p>“You’d better take him ashore. The captain
ain’t over and above fond of dogs, and he won’t
be likely to fall in love with one as ugly as that.”</p>

<p>“But he told me I could find a place for him
somewhere on the boat,” said Tim, quickly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
alarmed even at the suggestion that he part with
Tip.</p>

<p>“Did he tell you so before or after he hired
you?”</p>

<p>“Before I agreed to come he said I could keep
Tip with me,” replied Tim, wondering at the
question.</p>

<p>“Then he’ll forget he ever said so; and if you
think anything of the dog, you’d better leave him
on shore.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t,” cried Tim, piteously, his eyes
filling with tears. “Tip’s the only relation I’ve
got, an’ there’s no place where he could go.”</p>

<p>Tim’s distress touched the man’s heart, evidently,
for he said, after a moment’s thought:</p>

<p>“Then you must find some place on board
where the captain won’t be likely to see him,
for he would throw him overboard in a minute
if he took the notion. Come with me.”</p>

<p>The steward led the way to the bows of the
boat, where the freight was stored, and after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
looking about some time, pointed out a little
space formed by some water barrels.</p>

<p>“You’d better tie him in there for a while, and
then, if you are going to stay very long on the
boat, give him away.”</p>

<p>“But the captain said I might keep him with
me,” cried Tim, fearing to leave Tip in so desolate
a place.</p>

<p>“Well”—and now the steward began to grow
impatient—“you can try keeping him with you
if you want to run the risk, but I promise you
the captain will make quick work of him if he
sees him.”</p>

<p>Tim hesitated a moment, and then, stooping
down, he kissed Tip on the nose, whispering to
him:</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t leave you here if I could help it,
Tip; but be a good dog, an’ we’ll have it fixed
somehow pretty soon.”</p>

<p>Tip licked his master’s face in reply, but did
not appear to understand the command to be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
good dog; for when the rope was put around his
neck he began to howl dolefully, and his cries
went straight to Tim’s heart, inflicting as much
pain as a blow on his flesh.</p>

<p>With the tears dropping very fast from his
eyes, Tim tied Tip in the narrow place which
was to serve him as home, at least until Captain
Pratt’s intentions concerning him could be
known, and then returned to the cabin as the
steward had told him.</p>

<p>But as he started to go Tip looked up at him
so piteously, uttering a whine that sounded in
Tim’s ears so sad, that he ran back, knelt down
by his dumb friend, and kissed him over and over
again, saying, as he did so:</p>

<p>“Do be good, Tip. You don’t know how bad
it makes me feel to have to leave you here, an’
I’d do anything in the world to have you go with
me every step I take; but you’ve got to stay here,
Tip, an’ I’ve got to leave you.”</p>

<p>Then, as the dog whined again, he cried, passionately:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
“Oh, what lonesome things we are,
Tip! an’ we ain’t got anybody but each other
in all this wide world;” and, with both arms
around Tip’s neck, he gave way to a perfect flood
of tears.</p>

<p>“Now, <em>do</em> be good, Tip, an’ don’t make me
feel so bad,” he said, as he wiped his eyes on
the dog’s head, and prepared once more to leave
him.</p>

<p>It seemed almost as if the dog understood
what his master had said, for he stopped whining,
and made no sound, but kept wagging his
little stump of a tail till Tim did not dare to
look at him any longer.</p>

<p>He turned resolutely away, and, with eyes
still blinded with tears, walked down into the
cabin, where he was soon busily engaged in the
not very pleasant occupation of cleaning knives.</p>

<small>LIFE ON BOARD THE “PRIDE OF THE WAVE.”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When Tim first went on board the steamer
which was to be his home, he thought,
from the beautiful things he saw around, that
he should live in a luxurious manner; but when
he was shown the place in which he was to sleep,
he learned that the fine things were for the passengers
only, and that even comfort had been
sacrificed in the quarters belonging to the crew.</p>

<p>He was given a berth in the forecastle, which
was anything rather than a pleasant or even
sweet-smelling place; and had it not been that
he had the satisfaction of having Tip with him
when he went to bed, he would have cried even
harder and longer than he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>Captain Pratt had not made his appearance
on the steamer that day; but the steward had
told him that his duties as captain’s boy would
begin next morning at breakfast, when he would
be expected to wait upon the captain at the table.
The last thing Tim thought of that night was
how he should acquit himself in what he felt
would be a trying position, and the first thing
which came into his mind when he awoke on
the following morning was whether he would
succeed in pleasing his new employer or not.</p>

<p>After kissing Tip over and over again, and
with many requests to him to be a good dog and
not make a noise, Tim tied his pet in his narrow
quarters, and then made his own toilet. He
really made a good appearance when he presented
himself to Mr. Rankin, the steward, that
morning. His cheeks were rosy from a vigorous
application of cold water and a brisk rubbing;
and if he could rely upon his personal appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
for pleasing Captain Pratt, there seemed
every chance that he would succeed.</p>

<p>During the time he had been at work the day
before Mr. Rankin took every opportunity to
instruct him in his new duties, and that morning
the steward gave him another lesson.</p>

<p>It was barely finished when Captain Pratt
came into the cabin, and one look at him made
Tim so nervous that he forgot nearly everything
he had been told to remember.</p>

<p>The captain’s eyes were red, his hands
trembled, and he had all the appearance of a
man who had been drinking hard the day before,
and was not yet perfectly sober.</p>

<p>Tim had never had any experience with drinking
men; but he did not need any explanation
as to the causes of the captain’s appearance, and
he involuntarily ducked his head when his employer
passed him.</p>

<p>“Now, then, what are you skulking there for,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
you young rascal?” shouted Captain Pratt, as
he fell, rather than seated himself, in his chair.</p>

<p>“I ain’t skulkin’, sir,” replied Tim, meekly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you answer me back,” cried the captain,
in a rage, and seizing the milk pitcher as
if he intended to throw it at the boy. “If you
talk back to me I’ll show you what a rope’s end
means.”</p>

<p>Tim actually trembled with fear, and kept a
bright lookout, so that he might be ready to
dodge in case the pitcher should be thrown, but
did not venture to say a word.</p>

<p>“Now bring me my breakfast; and let’s see
if you amount to anything, or if I only picked
up a bit of waste timber when I got you.”</p>

<p>“What will you have, sir?” asked Tim,
timidly, as he moved toward the captain’s chair.</p>

<p>A blow on the side of his head that sent him
reeling half-way across the cabin served as a
reply, and it was followed by a volley of oaths
that frightened him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean by asking me what I’ll
have before you tell me what is ready? Next
time you try to wait upon a gentleman tell him
what there is. Bring me some soda-water first.”</p>

<p>This was an order that he had not been provided
for in the lessons given by Mr. Rankin,
and Tim stood perfectly still, in frightened ignorance.</p>

<p>“Come, step lively, or I’ll get up and show
you how,” roared the captain, his face flushing
to a deeper red, as his rage rose to the point of
cruelty.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, I don’t know where it is;” and
Tim’s voice sounded very timid and piteous.</p>

<p>“Don’t know where it is, and been on board
since yesterday! What do you suppose I hired
you for? Take that, and that.”</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the words, the cheerful-tempered
man threw first a knife and then a
fork at the shrinking boy, and was about to follow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
them with a plate, when Mr. Rankin put
into Tim’s hand the desired liquid.</p>

<p>Tim would rather have gone almost anywhere
else than close to his employer just then; but the
glass was in his hand, the captain was waiting
for it, with a glare in his eye that boded no good
if he delayed, and he placed it on the table.</p>

<p>“Now what kind of a breakfast have you got?”
shouted Captain Pratt as he swallowed the
liquid quickly.</p>

<p>It was a surprise to himself that he could
remember anything just then, but he did manage
to repeat the names of the different dishes,
and to take the captain’s order.</p>

<p>Although he ran swiftly as possible from the
table to the kitchen, and was served there with
all haste, he did not succeed in pleasing the
angry man.</p>

<p>“I want you to remember,” said that worthy,
with a scowl, “that I ain’t in the habit of waiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
for my meals. Another time, when you are so
long, I shall give you a lesson you won’t forget.”</p>

<p>Tim was placing the dishes of food on the
table when the captain spoke, and he was so
startled by the angry words, when he thought
he deserved pleasant ones, that he dropped a
plate of potatoes.</p>

<p>He sprang instantly to pick them up, but Captain
Pratt was out of his chair before he could
reach them, and, with all his strength, he kicked
Tim again and again. Then, without taking any
heed of the prostrate boy, who might have been
seriously injured, he seated himself at the table
in perfect unconcern.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin helped Tim on his feet, and, finding
that no bones were broken—which was remarkable,
considering the force with which the
blows had been given—advised him to go on
deck, promising that he would serve the captain.</p>

<p>“But I propose that the boy shall stay here,”
roared the captain. “Do you think I’m going to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
let him sneak off every time I try to teach him
anything?”</p>

<p>Tim struggled manfully to keep back the tears
that would come in his eyes as he stood behind
the captain’s chair; but they got the best of him,
as did also the little, quick sobs.</p>

<p>The captain appeared to grow more cheerful
as he ate; and although he called upon Tim for
several articles, he managed to get along without
striking any more blows, contenting himself by
abusing the poor boy with his tongue.</p>

<p>It was a great relief to Tim when that meal
was ended, and Mr. Rankin told him he could
eat his own breakfast before clearing away the
dishes.</p>

<p>Tim had not the slightest desire for food then;
but he did want some for Tip. Hastily gathering
up the bones from Captain Pratt’s plate, he
ran with them to the bow, where Tip was straining
and tugging at his rope as if he knew his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
master was having a hard time, and he wanted
to be where he could help him.</p>

<p>Tim placed the bones in front of Tip, and then
kneeling down, he put his arms around the dog’s
neck as he poured out his woes in his ear, while
Tip tried in every way to get at the tempting
feast before him.</p>

<p>“I’m the miserablest boy in the world, Tip,
an’ I don’t know what’s goin’ to become of us.
You don’t know what a bad, ugly man Captain
Pratt is, an’ I don’t believe I can stay here another
day. But you think a good deal of me,
don’t you, Tip? an’ you’d help me if you could,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>The dog had more sympathy with the bones
just then than he had with his almost heart-broken
master, and Tim, who dared not stay
away too long from the cabin, was obliged to
let him partake of the feast at last.</p>

<p>When Tim returned from feeding the dog
Mr. Rankin said all he could to prevent him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
from becoming discouraged on the first day of
service; but he concluded with these words:</p>

<p>“I can’t advise you to stay here any longer
than you can help, for you ain’t stout enough
to bear what you’ll have to take from the captain.
It’ll be hard work to get off, for he always
looks sharp after new boys, so they sha’n’t run
away; but when we get back here again you’d
better make up your mind to show your heels.”</p>

<p>These words frightened Tim almost as much
as what the captain had said to him, for he had
never thought but that he could leave whenever
he wanted to. Now he felt doubly wretched,
for he realized that he was as much a captive as
he had ever been when he lived with Captain
Babbige, whose blows were not nearly as severe
as this new master’s.</p>

<p>The <i>Pride of the Wave</i> made but two trips a
week, and each one occupied about two days
and a half. This second day after Tim had come
on board was the time of her sailing, and everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
was in such a state of confusion that no one
had any time to notice the sad little boy, who ran
forward to pet his dog whenever his work would
permit of such loving act.</p>

<p>Among his duties was that of answering the
captain’s bell, and once, when he returned from
a visit to Tip, Mr. Rankin told him, with evident
fear, that it had been nearly five minutes
since he was summoned to the wheel-house.</p>

<p>While the steward was speaking the bell rung
again with an angry peal that told that the party
at the other end was in anything but a pleasant
mood. It did not take Tim many seconds to run
to the wheel-house, and when he arrived there,
breathless and in fear, Captain Pratt met him
at the door.</p>

<p>“So the lesson I gave you this morning wasn’t
enough, eh?” cried the angry man, as he seized
Tim by the collar and actually lifted him from
his feet. “I’ll teach you to attend to business,
and not try to come any odds over me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>Captain Pratt had a stout piece of rope in one
hand, and as he held Tim by the other, nearly
choking him, he showered heavy blows upon the
poor boy’s back and legs till his arm fairly ached.</p>

<p>“Now see if you will remember that!” he
cried, as he released his hold on Tim’s collar,
and the poor child rolled upon the deck almost
helpless.</p>

<p>Tim had fallen because the hold on his neck
had been so suddenly released, rather than on
account of the beating; and when he struggled
to his feet, smarting from the blows, the captain
said to him:</p>

<p>“Now bring me a pitcher of ice-water, and
see that you’re back in five minutes, or you’ll get
the same dose over again.”</p>

<p>Tim limped away, his back and legs feeling
as if they had been bathed in fire, and each inch
of skin ached and smarted as it never had done
from the worst whipping Captain Babbige or
Aunt Betsey had favored him with. He entered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
the cabin with eyes swollen from unshed tears,
and sobs choking his breath, but with such a
sense of injury in his heart that he made no other
sign of suffering.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin was too familiar with Captain
Pratt’s methods of dealing with boys to be
obliged to ask Tim any questions; but he said,
as the boy got the water:</p>

<p>“Try to keep a stiff upper lip, lad, and you’ll
come out all right.”</p>

<p>Tim could not trust himself to speak, for he
knew he should cry if he did; and he carried
the water to the wheel-house, going directly
from there to Tip.</p>

<p>The dog leaped up on him when his master
came where he was, as if he wanted a frolic; but
Tim said, as he threw himself on the deck beside
him:</p>

<p>“Don’t, Tip, don’t play now; I feel more like
dyin’. You think it’s awful hard to stay here;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
but it’s twice as hard on me, ’cause the captain
whips me every chance he gets.”</p>

<p>Tip knew from his master’s actions that something
was wrong, and he licked the face that was
drawn with deep lines of pain so lovingly that
Tim’s tears came despite his will.</p>

<p>He was lying by Tip’s side, moaning and crying,
when old black Mose, the cook, was attracted
to the spot by his sounds of suffering.</p>

<p>“Wha-wha-wha’s de matter, honey? Wha’
yer takin’ on so powerful ’bout?”</p>

<p>Tim paid no attention to the question, repeated
several times, nor did he appear to feel the huge
black hand laid so tenderly on his head.</p>

<p>“Wha’s de matter, honey? Has Cap’en Pratt
been eddercaten’ of yer?” Then, without waiting
for a reply, he continued: “Now, don’ take
on so, honey. Come inter de kitchen wid ole
Mose, an’ let him soothe ye up a little. Come,
honey, come wid me, an’ bring de dorg wid yer.”</p>

<p>While he spoke the old colored man was untying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the rope which fastened Tip, for he knew
the boy would follow wherever the dog was led.
And in that he was right, for when Tip went
toward the little box Mose called a kitchen he
followed almost unconsciously.</p>

<p>Once inside the place where the old negro was
chief, Mose took his jacket off, and bathed the
ugly-looking black-and-blue marks which had
been left by the rope, talking to the boy in his
peculiar dialect as he did so, soothing the wounds
on his heart as he treated those on his body.</p>

<p>“Now, don’ feel bad, honey; it’s only a way
Cap’en Pratt has got, an’ you must git used to
it, shuah. Don’t let him fret yer, but keep right
on about yer work jest as ef yer didn’t notice him
like.”</p>

<p>Mose bathed the wounds, and gave Tip such
a feast as he had not had for many a day; and
when it was done Tim said to him:</p>

<p>“You’re awful good, you are; but I’m afraid
the captain will make you sorry for it. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
don’t seem to like me, an’ he may get mad ’cause
you’ve helped me.”</p>

<p>“Bress yer, chile, what you s’pose ole Mose
keers fur him ef he does git mad? The cap’en
kin rave an’ rave, but dis nigger don’ mind him
more’n ef he was de souf wind, what carn’t do
nobody any harm.”</p>

<p>“But—” Tim began to say, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Never mind ’bout any buts, honey. Yer fixed
all right now, an’ you go down in de cabin an’
go ter work like a man; ole Mose’ll keep keer ob
de dorg.”</p>

<p>Tim knew he had already been away from his
post of duty too long, and, leaving Tip in the
negro’s kindly care, he went into the cabin.</p>

<small>TIM MAKES AN ACQUAINTANCE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When Tim left old Mose’s kitchen it was
nearly time for the steamer to start on her
regular trip, and the passengers were coming on
board quite fast.</p>

<p>The bustle and excitement which always attend
the sailing of steamers, even though the trip
be a short one, were all so new and strange to
Tim that he forgot his own troubles in watching
the scene around him. He saw Mr. Rankin near
the kitchen, and was told by him that he could
remain on deck until the captain should ring his
bell, when he would let him know of it.</p>

<p>Therefore Tim had plenty of time in which to
take in all the details of the interesting scene.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
The deck-hands were scurrying to and fro,
wheeling in freight or baggage on funny little
trucks with very small wheels and very long
handles; passengers were running around excitedly,
as if they thought they ought to attend
to matters which did not concern them; newsboys
were crying the latest editions of the papers;
old women were trying to sell fruit that did not
look very fresh, and everything appeared to be
in the greatest confusion.</p>

<p>While Tim was leaning on the after-rail of
the main-deck his attention was attracted by a
very small boy, who was trying to get himself
and a large valise on board at the same time.
The valise was several sizes too large for the boy,
and some one of the four corners would persist
in hitting against his legs each time he stepped,
and then swinging around, would almost throw
him off his feet.</p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="i_fp075">
  <img src="images/i_fp075.jpg" alt="" title="">
  <figcaption class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_75">THE SMALL PASSENGER WITH THE LARGE VALISE</a></p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Twice the boy started to go on board, and each
time the valise grew unruly, frightening him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
from continuing the attempt lest he should be
thrown into the water. Then he stood still and
gazed longingly at the plank upon which he did
not dare to venture.</p>

<p>It was a comical sight, and Tim laughed at
it until he saw the boy was really in distress,
when he started to aid him.</p>

<p>“Let me help you carry your valise,” he said
to the small passenger, as he darted across the
narrow plank and took hold of one side of the
offending baggage. “Two can lug it better’n
one.”</p>

<p>The boy looked up as if surprised that a
stranger should offer to help him, and then gave
up fully one-half the burden to this welcome
lad. This time the journey was made successfully;
and as the valise was deposited on the
steamer’s deck the little passenger gave vent to
a deep sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“So much done,” he said, in a satisfied way,
as he took off his hat and wiped his forehead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
with a handkerchief that did not look much
larger than a postage-stamp. “Where are you
goin’?” he then asked, turning to Tim.</p>

<p>“Why, I ain’t goin’ nowhere,” replied the
captain’s boy, not fully understanding the
other’s question.</p>

<p>“Oh!”—and the boy’s face grew troubled—“I
thought maybe you was goin’ in the boat.”</p>

<p>“So I am,” answered Tim, now understanding
the question. “I work here.”</p>

<p>“Now, that’s nice;” and the little fellow sat
down on his valise contentedly.</p>

<p>“You may think so; but if you knew Captain
Pratt you’d talk different.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll find out sometime if you come
on this boat much; but I guess I’d better not
tell you.”</p>

<p>The boy was silent for a moment, as if he was
trying to understand what Tim meant, and then
he said, abruptly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>“Look here, I live down on Minchin’s Island,
an’ I come up here to see my aunt. I’m goin’
home on this boat, an’ I want you to show me
where I can get a ticket. If you will I’ll show
you lots of things I’ve got in this valise.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where it is myself, ’cause I
ain’t been on the boat only two days; but if
you’ll wait here I’ll go an’ ask the cook.”</p>

<p>The boy nodded his head, as if to say that
he would wait any reasonable length of time,
and Tim started off to gain the desired information
of old Mose.</p>

<p>In a few moments he returned, and taking his
new acquaintance by the hand, would have led
him to the clerk’s office at once, had not the
young party pulled back in evident alarm.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to take the valise with us, ’cause
somebody might steal it, an’ there’s two bundles
of torpedoes, a whole bunch of fire-crackers, an’
a heap of little sky-rockets in it.”</p>

<p>Tim understood at once, and, with a serious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
look on his face, as he thought of the great risk
he came near running, took hold of one of the
handles of the valise; the boy grasped the other,
and the two marched up to the clerk’s office.
There, after some little discussion, the ticket was
purchased, and the two retired to a more secluded
spot for conversation.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” the boy asked of Tim.
“Mine’s Bobby Tucker.”</p>

<p>Tim gave the desired information, and then
asked in turn:</p>

<p>“How long have you been up here?”</p>

<p>“’Most a whole week; an’ I’ve had the boss
time. I had five dollars an’ twenty cents that
I earned all myself, an’ I’ve got ’most half a
dollar left. Let’s go out on the wharf an’ buy
something.”</p>

<p>There was no chance that Tim would object
to any such brilliant idea, and the valise was
left with old Mose for safekeeping. Once on
the wharf, both they and the apple-women were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
very busy for five minutes, during which time
they—or rather, Bobby—bought fruit and
candies enough to make both of them as contented
as a boy could hope to be.</p>

<p>Luckily for Tim he got on the steamer again
just as one of the waiters came to tell him that
the captain had rung for him, and he lost no
time in making his way to the wheel-house. He
had the good-fortune to get there as quickly as
Captain Pratt thought he ought to have done,
and then got his employer’s coat from his state-room
as he was ordered.</p>

<p>After that he went back to his newly-made
friend, who was awaiting his return with considerable
impatience, for he did not feel exactly
certain that his valise with its precious contents
was perfectly safe.</p>

<p>Tim took him to the cook-room, and while
there showed him “one of the finest dogs in the
country,” which he led back to his old quarters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
so that he would be out of the way at dinner-time.</p>

<p>At first Bobby was not inclined to look upon
Tip either as a beautiful or a valuable animal;
but Tim sounded his pet’s praises so loudly that
Bobby could hardly prevent himself from being
convinced, even though appearances were so decidedly
against his companion’s words.</p>

<p>Among other stories which Tim related, as
showing that Tip was one of the most intelligent
of his species, was the incident of his finding
the cow so suddenly for Sam Simpson, which
pleased Bobby greatly, and he said, in a wise
tone both of praise and blame:</p>

<p>“He looks like a good dog, an’ he acts like a
good dog; but ’pears to me his legs is kinder
short if you wanted to make him run after a
bear.”</p>

<p>“I never tried to make him do that, ’cause
we don’t have bears up where I come from. Are
there any where you live?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I never saw any, an’ father says there
ain’t any; but I’ve heard ’em in the woods, an’
I know they was bears, ’cause they made such an
awful noise. You come down to see me some
time, an’ bring the dog with you, an’ we’ll kill
some.”</p>

<p>Tim was perfectly sure that Tip was able
to kill any number of bears, and he told his companion
so, adding that he hardly thought he
could get away from the steamer long enough
to make any kind of a visit; but Bobby felt sure
it could be arranged somehow.</p>

<p>While they had been talking about Tip the
boat had started, but, among the freight as they
were, they did not know it until the pitching of
the steamer as she left the harbor told that some
change had been and was being made in their
position.</p>

<p>Running hastily out to the rail, where they
expected to see the wharf, with its bustling crowd
of hucksters and passengers, they saw to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
astonishment the green, rolling billows of the
ocean. To Bobby, who lived on an island, the
sea was no new sight, and his astonishment was
only occasioned by the fact that the steamer had
left the dock; but to Tim, who had never seen
a body of water larger than the river in Selman,
the scene was one that filled him with the greatest
wonder.</p>

<p>He remained by the rail, only able to look
over the top of it by standing on his toes, and
gazed on the sea until Bobby asked, impatiently:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Ain’t sick, are yer?”</p>

<p>Until that question was asked Tim had not
thought of such a thing as being sea-sick; but
the moment Bobby spoke it seemed as if the
entire appearance of the water changed. Instead
of looking grand and beautiful it began
to have a sidelong motion, and to rise up and
down in an uncomfortable way.</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t sick,” he said to Bobby, “but I
feel kinder queer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>“That’s it! that’s it!” cried Bobby, eagerly;
“that’s the way folks begin when they’re goin’ to
be awful sick.”</p>

<p>Tim looked up in despair. Each succeeding
motion of the boat made him feel worse, and a
very uncomfortable sensation in the region of
his stomach was rapidly adding to his terror.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” he asked, in a piteous
whisper.</p>

<p>“Go to bed, an’ you’ll be all right in the
mornin’. Where’s your berth?”</p>

<p>Tim made a motion toward the forecastle, but
did not trust himself to speak. His stomach was
already in too queer a condition to permit of
words.</p>

<p>“I’ll go down with you, an’ see that you’re
all right,” said Bobby, sagely. “I’m used to
goin’ fishin’ with father, an’ I won’t be sick.”</p>

<p>Tim was about to follow his friend’s suggestion,
when the horrible thought occurred to him
of what the result might be in case Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
Pratt knew of his being in bed in the daytime,
and he went to ask advice of old Mose.</p>

<p>But one glance at his pale face and quivering
lips was needed to show the old negro that the
captain’s boy was sea-sick, and before Tim could
attempt to speak he said:</p>

<p>“Am yer sick, honey? There’s only one way
fur yer to do, an’ that’s to turn right in an’
wrastle it out. Go right to yer bunk, an’ I’ll
’form Mr. Rankin what ails you.”</p>

<p>This advice, although it was the same as that
given by Bobby, was followed at once, because
it came from a semi-official source, and in a few
moments afterward Tim was groaning in his
berth, while Bobby sat by his side, and tried to
persuade him to partake of some of the candy
he had bought just before leaving port.</p>

<p>Tim refused the offering, and for the first
time in his life looked upon candy as the stickiest
kind of a fraud. He felt as though the kindest
thing any one could do would be to throw him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
overboard in the midst of that treacherous sea
which was causing him so much internal commotion.</p>

<p>He had been in his berth about an hour, although
it seemed to him fully a week, when Mr.
Rankin came into the forecastle, and told him
that Captain Pratt had given positive and angrily
issued orders that he be brought on deck.</p>

<p>A moment before, Tim would have thought it
impossible for him to move, and felt that he
would not be frightened by a dozen Captain
Pratts; but the instant Mr. Rankin spoke, the
thoughts of that whipping, the smart of which
could still be felt, was sufficient to give him
strength to make the attempt.</p>

<p>Staggering to his feet, encouraged by the kind-hearted
steward, who pitied him sincerely, he
crawled up the narrow companion-way, shuddering
as he went, and catching his breath in
sickness and fear at each lurch of the steamer.</p>

<p>Bobby, who was awed into silence by the fear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
of the captain which he saw plainly written on
the faces of Mr. Rankin and Tim, would have
gone with his friend at least a portion of the way,
if Tim had not motioned him back. If he was
to be whipped for being sick, he very much
preferred that his new friend should not witness
the punishment.</p>

<p>It was with the greatest difficulty he managed
to keep on his feet as he staggered along the deck
to the wheel-house, and just as he reached there,
and had opened the door, a sudden lurch of the
steamer sent him spinning into the room headlong.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that Captain Pratt was
sitting directly opposite the door, smoking, for
he was directly in the way of Tim when the
steamer shot him into the wheel-house like a
stone from a sling, and the boy’s head struck
with no gentle force full on the chest of his irritable
employer.</p>

<p>The mildest-mannered man would have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
provoked if a boy, even no larger than Tim,
had been thrown at him in this way, and Captain
Pratt, always ill-tempered, had all his ire
aroused by the blow that very nearly took away
his breath.</p>

<p>As soon as he recovered from the effects of
the blow he seized Tim, who had continued on
his flight until he landed, a forlorn little specimen,
in one corner of the room, and shook him
as a cat shakes a mouse after she has had a long
chase to catch him.</p>

<p>“Is this the way you try to get even with me?”
cried the angry man, slapping Tim first on one
side of the head and then on the other with a
force that made his teeth chatter. “What do
you mean by such actions? Answer me! What
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean anything,” said the boy, piteously.
“I was comin’ in all right, when the boat
tipped up, an’ I slid right along. I was sea-sick,
an’ I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll show you how to get over your sea-sickness,
and you won’t forget how it’s done,
either;” and as the captain spoke he resumed
his cheerful occupation of slapping Tim’s face.
“You think I am going to have any lubbers
around here sick, do you?”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it, sir,” moaned Tim, who had
by this time lost all feeling of nausea in the pain
caused by the blows.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll help it for you,” roared the captain,
and he flogged Tim until he thought he had
been punished enough to cure him.</p>

<p>“Now see if that will help you,” he said, savagely,
as he stood Tim on his feet with a force
that caused him to bite his tongue. “Keep on
deck now, and let me see you every ten minutes.
If you so much as think of laying down I’ll give
you such a taste of the rope’s end that you’ll
think all this was only fooling.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Tim as if either the flogging or
the sickness would have been sufficient alone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
but to have both filled his heart with all the
sadness and grief it could well contain.</p>

<p>He went below, where Bobby was waiting
for him, and the sight of his tear-filled eyes, and
face red with the marks of the whipping, told
the young gentleman from Minchin’s Island that
there were very many positions in the world
more pleasant than that of captain’s boy on board
the <i>Pride of the Wave</i>.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Tim?” he asked, in a
half-whisper.</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” was the sobbing reply; and then
the boy ran to the only living thing he knew
who would sympathize with him in his grief.</p>

<p>Bobby stood back in astonishment as he saw
Tim lie down by the side of that wonderful
hunting dog, and, pouring out his grief in indistinct
words, sob and cry in deepest distress.</p>

<p>“What <em>is</em> the matter, Tim? Don’t cry so, but
tell me what ails you.”</p>

<p>It was some time before Tim would speak;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
but when once he did open his heart to his
newly-made friend he told the entire story from
the time he ran away from Captain Babbige’s
house up to the last whipping he had received.
When he had concluded he said, in the most
sorrowful tone:</p>

<p>“I jest wish I was dead, Bobby; for there don’t
seem to be anybody in all this great big world
who wants to have me ’round, ’less it is to lick me
when they ain’t got nothin’ else to do.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t stand it, Tim, that’s what I
wouldn’t do,” said Bobby, indignantly. “I’d jest
leave this old boat the very first time she stops.”</p>

<p>But Tim had more wisdom now than he had
the day he ran away from Captain Babbige, and
he said, mournfully:</p>

<p>“Where could I go if I did run away again?
Nobody wants me an’ Tip, an’ we’ve got to have
somethin’ to eat.”</p>

<p>This way of putting the matter rather confused
Bobby; he had never known what it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
to be without a home, and Tim’s lonely position
in the world opened his eyes to a new phase of
life.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what you can do: you can come
to my house, an’ stay jest as long as you want to.”</p>

<p>Tim shook his head; he remembered the invitation
given by Sam Simpson, and how it had
been seconded by his parents, and he did not care
for more of the same experience.</p>

<p>“But you can’t stay here an’ let Captain Pratt
knock you ’round.”</p>

<p>Tim assented to this; but still he did not see
how he could prevent it, unless he was willing
to risk suffering in another form.</p>

<p>“I s’pose I’ll have to go up-stairs an’ show the
captain that I ain’t in bed,” he said, as a shudder
of sea-sickness came over him again. “It must
be as much as ten minutes since I was there.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go,” said Bobby, stoutly; “I
wouldn’t let him think I was afraid of him.”</p>

<p>“But I am afraid of him, an’ so would you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
be if he was to beat you once the way he has
me;” and then he started for the deck again.</p>

<p>This time he did not attempt to enter the
wheel-house, but stood by the rail outside, where
the captain could see him, and leaned over the
side until it seemed to him that everything he
had eaten for the past month was thrown to the
fishes.</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to have waited on
the captain at the table that day, even if he had
been called upon so to do; but Mr. Rankin
had told him that he need not come into the
cabin until he had recovered, and he was truly
thankful for that permission to remain away,
as he hoped next day to be himself again.</p>

<p>The steamer had sailed at eleven o’clock in the
forenoon, and by two o’clock Tim was so sick
that the very worst punishment Captain Pratt
could have devised would not have troubled him
in the least.</p>

<p>The vessel tossed and plunged as if she were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
bent on going to the bottom of the sea at the first
opportunity, and Tim, in his berth, with the
faithful Bobby at his side trying to cheer and
comfort him, felt that he would not raise his
hand to help himself even though he knew the
<i>Pride of the Wave</i> was foundering.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_VII"><span class="smcap">Chapter VII.</span><br>
<small>TIP’S HURRIED LANDING.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">During the remainder of that day, and all
the night, Tim lay in his berth wondering
why it was he did not die, since he was so sick,
and expecting each moment that the steamer
would go to the bottom. He almost forgot Tip,
save once or twice when he asked Bobby to see
whether the dog was feeling as badly as he was;
and when he was told that Tip was apparently
enjoying very good health, he felt a sense of
injury because his pet did not share his sickness
with him.</p>

<p>Bobby remained with him nearly all the afternoon;
but toward night his newly-formed
friendship was not strong enough to keep him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
in the ill-smelling place, and he went on deck
to enjoy what was to him simply a glorious sail.</p>

<p>When Tim awakened on the following morning—for
he did get some sleep that night—the
steamer was yet pitching around wildly as
though she were mad, but he had recovered from
his sickness, and felt weak and hungry.</p>

<p>He looked as pale as though he had been confined
to his bed for a week, and he imagined he
was so thin that the sun would shine right
through him; but in this he was mistaken.</p>

<p>Of course his first visit was to Tip, and after
he had petted him to his heart’s content, and
given him a hearty breakfast, thanks to old
Mose’s generosity, he went below to report to
Mr. Rankin for duty.</p>

<p>There was plenty of work to be done; and
now that he had “paid his tribute to the sea,” the
steward showed that while he could be kind
when there was reason for it, he also believed
in making boys useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>Tim carried dishes, cleaned knives, ran with
cups of hot coffee or tea at imminent danger of
scalding himself, until all the passengers had
breakfasted, and then for at least an hour Captain
Pratt kept him going from the wheel-house
to the cabin, and from the cabin to the wheel-house,
on one errand or another, until he thought
he was sufficiently exercised.</p>

<p>All this time he had not once caught a glimpse
of his friend Bobby Tucker, nor, indeed, had he
had time to look for him. He had asked old
Mose where Minchin’s Island was, and when the
steamer would arrive there; but although Mose
could give him very little geographical information,
he knew certainly that the <i>Pride of the
Wave</i> was due at the island about noon.</p>

<p>Tim was impatient to get through with his
work, so that he could talk with Bobby a few
moments, and when Mr. Rankin told him that
he was at liberty until dinner-time, he went at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
once to Tip’s narrow quarters, believing he
would find the boy from Minchin’s Island there.</p>

<p>Nor was he mistaken, for there was Bobby
examining the dog very carefully, measuring his
legs and the stump of his tail, in order that he
might give accurate information regarding him
to his friends at home.</p>

<p>Although the boys were very glad to see each
other, the meeting was not a particularly affectionate
one.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bob!” cried Tim; and Bobby
answered,</p>

<p>“Hello, Tim!”</p>

<p>“What are you doin’ to Tip?”</p>

<p>“I was only kinder lookin’ him over, to see
if he was all right for the bears when he an’ you
come down to see me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, he can take care of the bears fast enough,
but I’m afraid he won’t get down to your house.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, he will,” was the confident reply.
“The very next time the <i>Pride</i> comes to the island<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
I’m goin’ to get father to make the captain
let you come ashore, an’ father’s one of the selectmen,
so I guess Captain Pratt can’t help hisself.”</p>

<p>The idea that Bobby’s father was one of the
town officials appeared to put the matter in a
different light, and Tim began to have great
hopes that the visit might really be made.</p>

<p>Then the chance of catching a bear, or of getting
near enough for Tip to catch one, was discussed.
Tip was unfastened in order that all
his beautiful proportions might be seen more
distinctly, and the boys grew so excited over
the subject that they forgot the flight of time,
until the steamer’s whistle aroused them from
thoughts of bear-killing.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” exclaimed Bobby, “here we’ve
got home, an’ I’d forgotten we was so near.”</p>

<p>“Was it Minchin’s Island the boat was whistlin’
for?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s the first place she stops at after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
she leaves the city. Come, quick, so’s we can get
my valise out of the kitchen.”</p>

<p>Bobby’s valise with its precious contents was
still in the care of Mose, its owner not having
looked after it more than once each hour, and
now he was very uneasy lest he should not be
able to get it in time.</p>

<p>Tim was so excited by his companion’s fears
that he fastened Tip as quickly as possible, not
noticing in his haste that the knot was only half
tied, and could easily be unloosened.</p>

<p>The valise, with apparently as much in it as
when it was intrusted to the old darkey’s care,
was soon in Bobby’s possession, and the two boys
went on the upper deck, from which the landing
was to be made.</p>

<p>Here, standing by the rail, Bobby pointed out
the various objects of interest on the island, not
forgetting the woods in which he was positive
Tip would one day roam in search of the ferocious
bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>Captain Pratt was standing near them, but he
was so much engaged in giving orders for the
proper landing of the boat that he did not notice
his cabin boy, who was breaking one of the rules
of the steamer by loitering on that deck.</p>

<p>The boat was still quite a distance from the
shore, and Bobby was pointing out his father’s
house when they heard a furious barking, and
before they could turn Tip was jumping up
around them. He had found no difficulty in
escaping from the half-tied rope, and after that
was done it was an easy matter for him to find
his young master.</p>

<p>Captain Pratt had heard Tip’s joyful greeting
also, and as he turned to see the cause of it,
the dog, who was in such high spirits at having
escaped from his imprisonment that he was ready
to show his good-will for every one, left the
boys and fawned upon the captain as if he was
his best friend.</p>

<p>Captain Pratt showed very little consideration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
for the dog, even while he thought he belonged
to one of the passengers, and gave him such a
kick as sent him half the length of the deck,
changing his note of joy to deep yelps of pain.</p>

<p>The place in which Tip had been confined was
anything but a clean one, and, as a natural consequence,
when he jumped upon the captain he
left the muddy imprints of his paws on the clean
blue clothes in which the commander of the
<i>Pride of the Wave</i> had that day arrayed
himself.</p>

<p>“Whose dog is that?” roared the captain, as
he surveyed the damage done.</p>

<p>“He’s mine,” answered Tim, who, at the first
blow struck his pet, had jumped toward the poor
brute and taken him to his bosom to soothe him.</p>

<p>Then it was that the captain first saw his cabin-boy
on the forbidden ground of the upper deck,
and it is positive that if he had had the time
just then he would have given him a painful
intimation of the mistake he had made. As it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
was, he walked up to Tim quickly, seized poor
Tip by the neck, and flung him as far as possible
into the water.</p>

<p>“Now you go below,” he said, in a low, angry
tone, to Tim, “and after we make this landing
I’ll settle with you.”</p>

<p>Tim paid no more attention to the captain’s
words than if they had been uttered by a boy
smaller than himself, but rushed frantically to
the rail as if he was about to jump after his pet.</p>

<p>The steamer was already so near the wharf
that Captain Pratt had no time to see if his
order was obeyed, but was obliged to give all
his attention to the management of the boat.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for Tip that the captain was
very angry when he threw him into the water,
since he, using all his strength, had tossed him
so far from the steamer’s side that he was in no
danger of being drawn under the wheel, as
would have been the case had less vigor been
used in the cruel deed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>Tip acted like a very sensible dog under the
circumstances—he held his head up and struck
out boldly for the shore, urged on by a crowd
of boys on the wharf.</p>

<p>Tim was almost frantic with grief, believing
his pet was perishing before his eyes, and he
powerless to save him. It is quite possible that
he would have obeyed his first impulse and
leaped into the water to try to save Tip, if a passenger
had not taken a firm hold of him.</p>

<p>“It’s a wicked shame! I’d jest like to take
that captain an’ do to him jest as he has done to
Tip; an’ he such a nice bear dog too!” said
Bobby, who stood by Tim’s side watching Tip’s
battle for life.</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose he’ll drown?” asked Tim, the
great tear-drops rolling down his cheeks.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” was the cautious reply. “It seems
to me his legs is rather short for swimmin’ very
far; an’ then, you see, he ain’t got any tail to
steer hisself by.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>Tim was just giving way to a fresh outburst
of grief at these words, which seemed to sound
Tip’s death-knell, when a gentleman said:</p>

<p>“There isn’t the slightest danger of his drowning.
It will take him some time to reach the
shore, for he’s not swimming directly toward it;
but he’ll come out all right, and it won’t do him
the least harm.”</p>

<p>“An’ jest as soon as I get ashore I’ll run round
an’ call him in, an’ bring him to you,” said
Bobby, anxious to do something toward saving
the life of an animal as valuable as he believed
Tip to be.</p>

<p>The dog was yet some distance from the shore
when the boat was made fast to the wharf, and
Bobby rushed on shore, going toward the point
where Tip must land, wholly regardless of his
parents, who were waiting to greet him.</p>

<p>Tim started to follow him, bent on saving his
pet and forgetting that there was such a person in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
the world as Captain Pratt, when he felt a heavy
hand laid on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I thought I told you to go below!” said an
angry voice, and, looking up, Tim saw it was
the captain who was detaining him. “If you
so much as make a motion to go on shore I’ll
whip you within an inch of your life!”</p>

<p>Then, without giving him an opportunity to
disobey, the same heavy hand pushed him back
on the deck, and Mr. Rankin led him forcibly
below.</p>

<p>“I won’t stay here! I won’t go down-stairs an’
leave Tip there to drown!” cried Tim, passionately.
“It’s awful wicked, an’ I won’t do it!”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Tim,” said Mr. Rankin, kindly
but firmly. “There is no possible chance that
your dog will drown, and you must come below,
for it is the captain’s orders.”</p>

<p>“But I must go an’ get him,” wailed Tim.</p>

<p>“Suppose you could get him before we leave
the dock, which you can’t, and suppose you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
should get him aboard without the captain’s seeing
you, which is an impossibility, what would
be the result? Captain Pratt would throw him
overboard after we got out to sea again, and then
he would be sure to drown.”</p>

<p>Tim knew the steward’s reasoning was correct,
and yet he refused to be comforted. He was led
below despite his struggles, but when he reached
the main-deck he ran to the rail, from where he
could see all that was going on in the water.</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose he will get ashore all right?”
Tim asked of Mr. Rankin, as he watched Tip’s
exertions to save himself.</p>

<p>“Of course he will; he’s almost there now,
and in five minutes more he’ll be just as safe
as ever, and a good deal cleaner.”</p>

<p>By this time the freight for the island had
been landed, and the steamer was already leaving
the wharf. Tim was in an agony of fear lest he
should be obliged to depart without assuring
himself that Tip was a saved dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>But in order that the steamer should be put
on her course again it was necessary to back her
for some distance, and that was a bit of good luck
for Tim, since they moved in the direction
taken by Tip.</p>

<p>Tim could see Bobby, at the extreme point of
land that jutted out into the sea, urging the dog
to increased exertion, and aided by all the boys
who were on the wharf at the time Tip was
thrown overboard, as well as by a number of
others who had learned of the excitement by seeing
Bobby as he ran around the shore.</p>

<p>Just as the steamer’s paddle-wheels ceased to
force her back, and began to urge her in the
opposite direction, Tip’s short legs touched the
bottom, and in another instant Bobby was holding
him, all wet and dripping, high up in the
air, while he executed a sort of triumphant war-dance
before Tim’s delighted gaze.</p>

<p>Tim stood looking with his very heart in his
eyes as the <i>Pride of the Wave</i> carried him farther<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
and farther from the only friend he had
in the world, and when he saw Tip run along
the beach and shake himself he laughed from
very joy.</p>

<p>But in another instant he understood that, if
the dog was safe, he was being separated from
him very rapidly.</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t see him ever again in this life,” he
wailed, “an’ he is the only feller that cares anything
about me.”</p>

<p>Then he ran to the little hole which had served
Tip as a state-room, and there gave vent to his
sorrow in passionate weeping.</p>

<small>MINCHIN’S ISLAND.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When Tim had so far recovered from his
grief as to present himself for work again,
Minchin’s Island was far astern, and the voyage
drawing rapidly to an end.</p>

<p>Those who were friendly to the boy thought
the wisest and kindest course to pursue was to
say nothing about poor Tip; and as those who
were not friendly did not speak of him, Tim got
on without giving way to his grief in public.
Captain Pratt seemed to have forgotten his
threat of punishing Tim for venturing on the
upper deck, or he may have thought best to
wait till the end of the trip, for he said nothing
to the boy, which was far more kind than he had
any idea of being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>At the different landings Tim did not have
curiosity enough to look at the towns, but worked
as hard as he could in order to prevent thinking
about poor Tip. Captain Pratt summoned him
to the wheel-house several times, and whenever
he went there he felt certain he was to receive
the promised whipping; but he was mistaken,
for, after ordering him to do some trifling work,
the captain paid no attention to him.</p>

<p>At about six o’clock on the afternoon of that
day the steamer was made fast to the wharf at
Bedlow, and the trip was ended.</p>

<p>After the work of cleaning the cabin was done
Mr. Rankin said:</p>

<p>“You can go ashore and see the town, if you
want to; but be back by nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>Tim shook his head; he had no desire to see
anything new, since Tip was not there to enjoy
the sights with him, and he crept off to his dirty
berth in the forecastle, where he cried himself
to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>On the next morning he succeeded in supplying
the captain’s wants at the table as quickly
as that gentleman thought proper, and yet no
mention was made of the events of the previous
day.</p>

<p>The steamer was to leave Bedlow on her return
trip at noon, and Tim took no interest in the
bustle and excitement on the wharf, save that
each succeeding moment was one less in the time
that must elapse before he saw Tip again.</p>

<p>As the steamer started his spirits rose, and he
watched her course carefully, fretting at the
time spent at each landing, content only when
she was going at regular speed toward Minchin’s
Island and Tip.</p>

<p>He had formed no plan as to what he should
do when he got there. He knew that Mr. Rankin’s
advice that Tip be left there was good,
and should be followed, but he could not make
up his mind to do so. Parting with Tip seemed
like parting with a portion of his very life, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
he could not bring himself to say that he would
leave this his only friend, no matter how short
the time.</p>

<p>It was nearly nightfall when the steamer
neared Minchin’s Island, and Tim was as far in
the bow as he could get on the main-deck, in
order that he might catch the first glimpse of
Tip, for he felt sure Bobby would bring him
to the wharf.</p>

<p>At last he could distinctly see the different objects
on the wharf, and his heart sunk when he
failed to see any one who at all resembled Bobby.
He looked eagerly among the crowd assembled,
and could not even see one boy, when on the day
before there had been at least twenty there. He
was at a loss to account for this cruelty on
Bobby’s part. He knew the dog had been
saved, for he had surely seen him held aloft in
Bob’s arms, and a cruel suspicion came into his
mind that perhaps the boy was keeping out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
sight with the intention of claiming Tip as his
own.</p>

<p>The boat arrived at the wharf, and was made
fast. Not a single boy or dog could be seen.</p>

<p>Tim’s heart was full to bursting, and as he
leaned against the rail he thought it was not
possible for greater trouble to come to him, since
he was denied even a sight of Tip.</p>

<p>Now he would willingly have promised that
the dog should remain with Bobby, if by making
such promise he could see and hug him each time
the boat arrived at that place.</p>

<p>So absorbed was he with his grief, caused by
what looked very like an act of perfidy on
Bobby’s part, that he failed to notice what several
of the employés on the steamer saw and wondered
at. A man had called Captain Pratt on
shore, and was talking to him in such a manner
as to make him angry. So excited was he that
he paid no attention to the fact that the steamer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
was ready to continue the trip, and that every
one waited for him.</p>

<p>Tim saw nothing of all this; but when the
captain called loudly to him he started, as if
he had been caught in wrongdoing.</p>

<p>“Come ashore here!” cried the captain, much
as if he was angry with himself for giving such
an order.</p>

<p>Tim walked on to the wharf in a perfect maze
of surprise, and when he went near his employer
his wonder was increased by hearing that
gentleman say to the one he had been talking
with, “Here’s the boy, and I wish you joy of
him;” and then to see him go quickly on board
the steamer.</p>

<p>Before Tim had time to recover from his surprise
the steamer had started, and as she was
leaving the wharf he was almost taken off his
feet by some soft substance that hit him on the
legs.</p>

<p>It did not take him many seconds to discover<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
that this substance which had struck him so suddenly
was his own little bob-tailed Tip, and
then he knelt right down on the wharf and
hugged him desperately, giving no heed to anything
save the happy fact that he had his pet to
himself once more.</p>

<p>Some time before he had finished hugging and
kissing Tip a noisy crowd of boys emerged from
behind one of the freight sheds, where they had
evidently been in hiding, and gave him such a
welcome to Minchin’s Island as he never expected
to receive anywhere.</p>

<p>Bobby was among the number, of course, and
it was so long before he could calm himself down
sufficiently to explain the meaning of all the
strange occurrences, that Tim was left some time
in doubt as to whether he had really gotten away
from the savage Captain Pratt, or if it was all
a pleasant dream, from which he would awake
to receive the promised flogging.</p>

<p>When Bobby did sober down sufficiently to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
talk understandingly, Tim learned that, owing
to his friend’s pleading and tales of how he had
been abused, Mr. Tucker had promised that he
would induce Captain Pratt to let the boy come
ashore at Minchin’s Island, where he should
have a home for a time at least.</p>

<p>Relying on that promise, Bobby had gathered
all the boys of the town together to give Tim a
proper welcome, and all had been hidden behind
the shed when the steamer came in, so that
the surprise should be as great as possible. By
what means Mr. Tucker had persuaded Captain
Pratt to part with the cabin-boy he was
“breaking in” no one knew, and no one seemed
to care, since it had been so successfully accomplished.</p>

<p>When Bobby looked around for his father,
to introduce to him the boy for whom he had
done so much, he was nowhere to be seen, and
Bobby said, in apology:</p>

<p>“I s’pose he thought we would want to talk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
a good deal, an’ so he went off; but we’ll see him
when we get home.”</p>

<p>“But am I really goin’ to live with you?”
asked Tim, hardly able to believe the good-fortune
that had come to him so suddenly.</p>

<p>“You’re goin’ to live with me a good while,
anyhow, an’ I guess for all the time; but father
didn’t say.” Then, as the boys started up the
wharf, he added, eagerly, “We’re goin’ over to
Bill Thompson’s father’s vessel now. We’ve
got some chowder, an’ Bill’s father said we
could go over there an’ have supper; so we’re
goin’ to show you one of the best times you ever
had.”</p>

<p>The countenance of all the boys told that some
big time was near, and more especially was that
the case with Bill Thompson. By his very manner
he showed that he considered himself of the
greatest importance in that party, and walked
on in advance, almost unable to contain himself
because of his excessive dignity. Instead of going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
up into the little town, Bill led the way
around the shore; and as the boys reached the
headland where Tip had first touched the land
of Minchin’s Island, Bobby pointed to a small
fishing schooner that lay at anchor a short distance
from the shore.</p>

<p>Then the other boys began to tell about the
supper and the good time generally, until it was
impossible to distinguish one word; but Bill
Thompson walked on in silence, looking neither
to the right nor the left. It was enough for him
that he was the one on whom the pleasure depended,
since it was to take place on his father’s
vessel, and he could not lower his dignity by
talking.</p>

<p>A dory hauled up on the beach served to convey
the party to the schooner, and once there,
Bill Thompson led the way to the cabin, where
every preparation had been made for the feast
of welcome.</p>

<p>The table, formed by letting down a shelf<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
from the side of the cabin, was large enough to
accommodate half of the party, and was laid
with every variety of crockery and cutlery such
as would be likely to be found on board a fishing
vessel. The only food on the table was crackers;
but a huge pot, which was bubbling and steaming
in a contented sort of way on the stove, told
that there was enough to satisfy the wants of the
hungriest boy there.</p>

<p>“Set right down to the table, Tim,” said Bill,
unbending from his dignity a little, “an’ the rest
of us will do the work; you’re the company,
you know.”</p>

<p>Tim took the place of honor—the only armchair
in the cabin—and was more than gratified
to find that a seat had been placed close beside
him for Tip, who had already jumped on it, sitting
there looking as wise and hungry as a dog
could look.</p>

<p>The entire boy portion of the population of
Minchin’s Island had worked hard and earnestly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
to prepare this feast of welcome, and the result
of their labors was the chowder, which was being
served by the means of a cocoa-nut shell dipper,
with a large hole in the side, that somewhat retarded
the progress.</p>

<p>At last all were served, and those who could
not find places at the table were seated on the
sides of the berths, on trunks, fishing-tackle, or
any available space, and the feast was begun.</p>

<p>Tip had his share in a saucer, and he ate it
in as dignified a manner as the best-behaved dog
could have done.</p>

<p>For several moments all gave their undivided
attention to the chowder, which was not exactly
as good as they were accustomed to at home,
but which, being the product of their own labor,
tasted better than anything they had ever eaten
before.</p>

<p>Especially to Tim was it good, because of the
spirit which prompted its manufacture, and because
it was an evidence of their good-will to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
him. Tip rather turned his nose up at it, however.
Since his arrival at Minchin’s Island he
had been petted and fed by every boy in town,
thanks to Bobby’s stories of his ability as a bear
dog, until now it required something more than
ordinary food to tempt his appetite.</p>

<p>But the feast was not the only way by which
the boy who had come among them was to be
honored, as Tim soon found out. A very elaborate
programme had been arranged, and not one
single detail was to be omitted.</p>

<p>Bill Thompson, with his mouth uncomfortably
full, arose to his feet in such a clumsy manner
that he upset what remained of Bobby’s chowder,
very much to the disadvantage of the table-cloth
and his trousers, and said, with some hesitation:</p>

<p>“Mr. Babbige, we fellers heard all about you
last night from our esteemed feller-citizen, Mr.
Bob Tucker, an’ we wanted to do something to
show you what we thought of you.”</p>

<p>Here Bill stopped to swallow a portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
cracker that impeded his speech, and Tim looked
around him in blank amazement, not understanding
this portion of the proceedings. Bill
continued, in the most serious manner:</p>

<p>“We knowed what a hard time you was havin’
on the <i>Pride</i>, an’ we wanted to have you come
an’ live here, ’cause we thought we should like
you, an’ ’cause you had such a fine dog. This
little chowder welcome ain’t all we’ve got for
yer. To-morrer we’re goin’ to take Tip an’ you
out in the woods, an’ we’ve decided that the first
bear he kills shall be skinned, an’ the skin nailed
up on Bobby Tucker’s father’s barn, where
everybody can see what your Tip has done.”</p>

<p>At that point Bobby Tucker slyly pinched
Tip’s stub tail, and he uttered such a yelp that
the remainder of the company applauded
loudly, thinking he must have understood what
was said.</p>

<p>When the noise ceased Bill bowed gracefully
to Tip, as an acknowledgment of his appreciation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
and, having swallowed that which had been
in his mouth, was able to speak more plainly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Babbige, we fellers want to ’gratulate
you on gettin’ off the <i>Pride</i>, an’ more ’specially
on comin’ to this town, where the fellers will
treat you an’ Tip as you ought to be treated. We
hope you’ll stay forever with us, an’ never want
to go away. Now, fellers, I say three cheers for
Tip an’ Tim Babbige.”</p>

<p>The cheers were given with a will, causing
Tim’s face to turn as red as a boiled beet, while
his confusion was as great as his face was red.</p>

<p>As soon as the noise had died away Bobby
was on his feet, ready to express his opinion on
the subject.</p>

<p>“Mr. Tim—I mean Tim—no, Mr. Timothy
Babbige,” he began, very earnestly; but his difficulty
in getting the name right so confused him
that he forgot what he was to say next. He
cleared his throat until his voice was as hoarse
as an aged frog’s, and yet no words came. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
he seized a glass of water, drinking it so fast that
he gasped and choked until the tears came into
his eyes and his face became as red as Tim’s.</p>

<p>“Mr. Babbige,” he began; but Tim’s big eyes
were fixed on him so pityingly that he was all at
sea again so far as words were concerned. At
length, making a desperate effort, he said:
“Well, we’re glad to see you here, Tim, an’ we
mean to make it jest as lively for you as we
know how.”</p>

<p>Then Bobby sat down, very much ashamed
that he had made such a failure; but when the
boys cheered him as loudly as they had Bill he
began to think it was quite a speech after all.</p>

<p>Every one now looked expectantly at Tim, and
he knew he was obliged to make some reply. He
gazed at Tip, and Tip gazed at him; but no inspiration
came from that source, and he stood
up in a desperate way, feeling that as a rule he
had rather go hungry than pay such a price for
a supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“Fellers,” he said, loudly, believing, if the
thing must be done, the more noise the better,
“I want to thank you all for what you did for
Tip when you pulled him out of the water, an’
for what you’ve done for me. The chowder was
splendid—”</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by loud and continued
applause for his delicate compliment to
their skill as cooks, and it was some moments
before he could continue:</p>

<p>“Tip an’ me have had a nice time eatin’ it, an’
we’re a good deal more glad to be here than you
are to have us.”</p>

<p>He could think of nothing more to say, and
was about to sit down when Bobby asked: “What
about killin’ the bears?”</p>

<p>“I’d most forgotten about them,” he said, as he
straightened himself up and looked down at Tip
with pride. “If you’ve got any bears round here
that wants to be killed, Tip will fix ’em for you;
but if you want to save the skins to nail up on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
the barn, you must rush in an’ catch Tip before
he chews ’em all up. Why, I saw Tip catch a
woodchuck once, an’ before you could say ‘scat’
he’d chewed him awfully. So you’ll have to be
kinder careful of your bears when Tip once gets
his eye on ’em.”</p>

<p>That was the end of Tim’s speech, for the applause
was so great that for the next five minutes
it would have been useless for any one to
try to make himself heard.</p>

<p>It was very near nine o’clock by the time the
formal welcome to Tim was concluded, and
after the cabin had been cleaned Bill Thompson
said, as he wiped the dish-water from his
hands, smoothed down his hair, and made himself
presentable for an appearance at home:</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better go now, an’ to-morrer
mornin’ we’ll go round back of Bobby Tucker’s
father’s woodshed an’ fix up about the bear-hunt.”</p>

<p>The idea that they were to start the ferocious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
bear from his lair so soon caused a fresh burst
of enthusiasm, and each one made another and
a personal examination of Tip, until the much-inspected
dog came very near being cross.</p>

<p>It was rather a sleepy party that clambered
over the side of the schooner that night; but it
was a party that had the most absolute faith in
Tip Babbige’s ability to kill all the bears on the
island.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_IX"><span class="smcap">Chapter IX.</span><br>
<small>THE FAMOUS BEAR-HUNT.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When Tim went home with Bobby he saw
Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, and from them received
such a kindly greeting that he thought he
must be remarkably good in order to repay them
for their kindness.</p>

<p>He was a happy boy when he went to bed that
night, and made more so by seeing Tip stretched
out on a rug by the side of the bed whenever he
took the trouble to look that way.</p>

<p>On the first morning after Tim’s arrival Mr.
Tucker, without saying what his intentions were
regarding the future of the homeless boy, told
him and Bobby they could enjoy themselves after
their own fashion for two weeks, at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
which time school began. Therefore there was
nothing to prevent the bear-hunt from taking
place, unless it should be the failure of the bears
to show themselves.</p>

<p>Tip was fed on the choicest morsels which
could be procured; and so anxious were the boys
that he should be in the best possible fighting
trim, that it was proposed to rub him thoroughly
with lard, to make his joints more supple, that
he might be able to run swiftly when chasing the
game.</p>

<p>This idea was discarded, however, very shortly
after they attempted to carry it into execution,
owing to a decided difference of opinion on Tip’s
part, who made such serious objections to it
that Bobby concluded perhaps he could run just
as well if his joints were not quite so limber.</p>

<p>Bill Thompson was the first of the party to
arrive at the rendezvous back of the shed, and,
almost before he spoke to the boys, he made another
and a more critical examination of Tip.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
Bill was not only eager for the fray, but he was
thoroughly well armed. He had a murderous-looking
carving-knife stuck in a belt that had
been hastily made of a strip of black cloth, and
in his hands he carried a small shot-gun, which
he might have some difficulty in discharging,
owing to the fact that he was obliged to carry
the lock in his pocket.</p>

<p>When Bill’s attention was called to this fact
he explained that he did not depend so much
upon the gun to shoot with as he did for use as
a club, with which the bear’s brains could be
easily dashed out. The knife was the weapon in
which he put more dependence, and he proved
that it was a good one by making shavings of
fully half a shingle in less than five minutes.</p>

<p>This display of weapons and air of ferocity
on Bill’s face so pleased Tim and Bobby that
they blamed themselves severely for not having
made their own preparations for a fight. That
oversight was quickly remedied when Bobby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
produced an old army musket, the weight of
which made him stagger, and a small pistol that
had been loaded nearly a year, the charge having
obstinately refused to come out.</p>

<p>“You’ll want the pistol, Tim,” he said, as he
handed that weapon to his friend, “’cause it’ll
be a good deal handier to fire when you’re close
up to the bear, an’ you know you’ll have to go
pretty snug to him, so’s to keep Tip from eating
the skin.”</p>

<p>Tim took the pistol carefully, looked down
into the muzzle, as if wondering at which end
it would be safest to stand when the weapon
was finally discharged, and then secured it by
sticking it between the waist-band of his trousers
and shirt.</p>

<p>Bobby, with all possible precaution against
accidents, loaded the army musket with the powder
taken from six fire-crackers, and rammed
home five or six small stones in place of bullets.
He had no percussion-caps; but he felt certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
he could discharge it as well by holding a lighted
match at the nipple as if he had all the caps ever
made. Owing to Bobby’s mother’s decided refusal
to loan two of her carving-knives, they were
obliged to get along without anything of that
sort, and depend on the one carried by Bill to
skin their game when it was killed.</p>

<p>The other hunters arrived in parties of twos
and threes, and each new arrival thought it necessary
to make another and more minute examination
of Tip, in order to be certain that he was
in the best possible condition for the hunt. Each
of the new-comers was armed, but none could
boast of having more destructive weapons than
those carried by the three leaders.</p>

<p>Bill was anxious to start at once, in order,
as he said, to get the skin nailed up on the barn
before night; and as they were about to set out
Bobby cried, in tones of horror:</p>

<p>“Here! how do you s’pose we can get any
bears if we let Tip go on ahead? Why, he’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
rush off jest as soon as he sees one, an’ we can’t
catch him before he eats ’em all up.”</p>

<p>It was almost a shudder that ran through the
party as they realized how near they had been to
losing their game before it had been caught, and
the greatest excitement reigned.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Bill, completely
at a loss to arrange matters; and then, as a happy
thought came to him, he cried: “I know now: we
can take turns carryin’ him.”</p>

<p>A look of scorn came upon Bobby’s face as
this brilliant idea was given words, and he said,
almost with a sneer:</p>

<p>“Now, what a way that would be, wouldn’t it?
How do yer s’pose he could smell out the tracks
if we didn’t let him run on the ground?”</p>

<p>That one question made Bill Thompson feel
very cheap indeed, for it showed plainly that he
was not posted in bear-hunting, and he was anxious
to be looked upon as one who knew all about
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>“What shall we do, then?” he asked, mournfully.</p>

<p>“We must tie a rope round his neck, so’s we
can hold him back.”</p>

<p>Bill actually looked ashamed when this very
simple plan was proposed, and he was angry
with himself for not having been the first to
think of it. But he saw a way to save his
reputation.</p>

<p>“That’s a good plan,” he said, gravely, as if
he had thought of it before, but had not suggested
it, hoping a better one would be proposed;
“but you’ll want more’n one rope. Why, if Tip
should see a bear suddenly he’d break the biggest
rope we could get, an’ go after him before
we’d know anything.”</p>

<p>Every boy there agreed with Bill, and again
he stood high as an experienced bear-hunter.</p>

<p>Bobby got two pieces of an old clothes-line,
each about five yards long, and these were fastened
securely around Tip’s neck; while Tim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
and Bobby each held an end, with the understanding
that, if the dog struggled very hard to
get away, the others of the party were to rush
in and help hold him.</p>

<p>Poor Tip appeared very sorrowful at this lack
of confidence, as shown by the ropes, and his
short tail, which had stuck straight up, owing
to the excitement around him, now hung down in
a sad way.</p>

<p>“He don’t like it,” said Tim, as he tried to
cheer Tip by patting him on the head. “He
wants to rush right in an’ chew ’em all up, that’s
what’s the matter with him.”</p>

<p>No one doubted that statement, and admiring
glances were bestowed upon the very small but
very ferocious dog.</p>

<p>The party was ready for the start, and the
precautions they took even before they were
clear of the shadow of the wood-shed told that
they did not intend to lose any game by carelessness.
Tim and Bobby went in advance, leading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Tip, who did not make the slightest effort
to get away, and followed by Bill Thompson,
carrying his gun in one hand and his knife in
the other. Then came the remainder of the
party, near or at a distance, as their fear of bears
was much or little.</p>

<p>Although it could hardly be expected that any
bear had been so venturesome as to cross a field
almost in the centre of the town, Tip was encouraged
to smell of the ground, and each of the
boys was ready for an immediate attack before
they were beyond the sound of Mrs. Tucker’s
voice.</p>

<p>The march to the edge of the grove was necessarily
a slow one, for Tip, finding that he was
encouraged to run from one side of the path to
the other, did so to his heart’s content, while the
boys expected each moment to see him start off
like a race-horse, and were ready to spring at
once to the aid of Tim and Bobby.</p>

<p>If their caution was great before they left the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
field, it would be almost impossible to find a
word to express their movements when they entered
the woods. Every weapon was handled as
though it was to be used at once, and the greater
portion of the time every eye was fixed on Tip.
But not once had the noble animal drawn taut
the ropes that held him, not once had he shown
any desire to start away at any furious rate of
speed. But after half an hour he suddenly
smelled of the ground, and then started away at
a run, which made the excitement most intense.</p>

<p>“He’s after the bear now, sure!” cried Bill
Thompson, as he brandished his knife savagely,
and swung his gun around, so that it would be
ready for use as a club.</p>

<p>At this startling announcement one or two of
the boys who had been careful to keep well in the
rear ran considerably slower, as if they were perfectly
willing their companions should have all
the glory and fight, while one of the party actually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
turned his back on the prospective scene
of carnage and went home.</p>

<p>On sped Tip, now really pulling on the ropes,
and Bobby’s face grew pale as he thought how
rapidly he was being forced toward the dangerous
and anxiously expected fight.</p>

<p>Tip, not understanding that two boys were
obliged to follow directly behind him, and, still
hot on the scent of some animal, suddenly darted
between a couple of trees standing very near
each other.</p>

<p>It was impossible for both Tim and Bobby to
pass through this narrow space together; but in
their excitement they did not stop to think of
that, and the consequence was that they both fell
sprawling to the ground, while Tip was brought
to a very sudden stop.</p>

<p>The dog seemed rather discouraged by the
sudden check to his speed, and it was some time
before he could be persuaded to start again.
This second race had just begun, and the boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
were growing eager again, when Bill Thompson
shouted:</p>

<p>“There he is! there he is! Hold on to your
dog now, an’ let’s get all ready before we rush
in.”</p>

<p>“Where is he? where is he?” asked each one,
as he halted and tried to distinguish the form
of the animal in the direction pointed out by
Bill; but none of them feeling quite as brave as
they did a moment before.</p>

<p>“Look right there!” and Bill pointed to a certain
spot in the woods where the trees grew
thickest. “Now watch, an’ you’ll see him move.”</p>

<p>It was possible to see some dark-colored body
moving among the thick foliage, and there was
no longer any doubt but that one of the animals
they were in search of was very near to them.</p>

<p>A shade of fear came over the faces of quite
a number of that hunting party then, and the
most frightened-looking one was Bobby Tucker.
He, who had been so proud a few moments before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
because he had been given the post of honor,
now appeared to be perfectly willing that some
one else should hold Tip when the expected rush
was made, and he appeared to have suddenly lost
all desire for a bear-hunt.</p>

<p>Bill Thompson now assumed the command of
the party, and no one questioned his right to do
so. The orders he gave were obeyed as promptly
as could have been expected under the circumstances,
and he began the delicate task of posting
his men in those positions best calculated to
bring out their fighting qualities.</p>

<p>Tim and Bobby, being nearer the dangerous
animal than the others, were ordered to keep
strict watch of the spot where the bear was last
seen, and on no account to let him get away
without their knowledge.</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes right on him,” shouted Bill
to the two who were preventing Tip from eating
the bear. “The first minute he starts to run let
Tip go, an’ yell as loud as you can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>Then he ordered this boy behind a tree, and
another into the branches, making such a warlike
hubbub as probably was never before heard
in those woods. Meanwhile Tip had concluded
the best thing he could do was to take a rest, and
he lay at full length under the tree, as if such
an idea as chewing a bear had never entered his
head.</p>

<p>Finally Bill made all his arrangements, and
cautiously stepped a yard or two in advance,
with both knife and gun ready for instant use.</p>

<p>“What do you think, Tim, had we better rush
right in, or shall we throw a stone, an’ let Tip
catch him when he runs out?” he asked, in a
whisper, as if he was afraid of scaring the beast
after all the noise that had been made.</p>

<p>“Heave a stone in; that’s the best way,” said
Bobby, quickly, not liking the idea of being one
of the party who were to make the rush.</p>

<p>Nearly all the boys showed that they preferred
the most peaceable way of commencing the fight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
and Bill prepared to start the savage beast from
his lair.</p>

<p>At first he was at a loss to know what to do
with his weapons while he cast the stone that
might do so much mischief; but finally he arranged
it to his satisfaction by holding the knife
under his left arm, so that it could be drawn
readily, and by keeping the gun in his left hand.</p>

<p>“Now look out!” he shouted, “an’ be ready
to let Tip go when the bear comes out. All yell
as loud as you can when I fire, so’s to scare him.”</p>

<p>Then Bill raised his arm, took deliberate aim
at the centre of the clump of bushes, and threw
the stone.</p>

<p>The instant he did so he grasped his knife, and
the others set up such a cry as ought to have
startled a dozen bears.</p>

<p>It was some seconds before any sign was made
that the animal in hiding even knew the stone
had been thrown, and then there was a movement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
in the bushes as if it had simply changed
its position—nothing more.</p>

<p>Bill stood silent with astonishment; he had
expected to see that bear come out of the bushes
with a regular flying leap, and he was thoroughly
disappointed.</p>

<p>“Better let Tip go in an’ snake him right out,”
suggested Bobby, who was afraid Bill would
again propose a charge by the party.</p>

<p>Bill looked at Tim to see what he thought of
such a plan, and the dog’s owner nodded his head
in approval.</p>

<p>“Then all get ready, an’ take the rope off his
neck,” shouted Bill, as he set his teeth hard
because of the struggle that it was evident would
come soon.</p>

<p>Having the most perfect faith in the ability of
his dog to kill any animal not larger than an
elephant, Tim cautiously untied the ropes. But
Tip did not appear to be excited by the prospect;
he did not even get up from the ground, but lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
there wagging his stub tail as if he was playing
at “thumbs up.”</p>

<p>“Set him on!” cried Bill, tired of the inactivity;
and Tim, now afraid his pet might be
accused of cowardice, set him on with the most
encouraging cries of “S’t-aboy!” But Tip, instead
of running toward the bear, seemed to be
bewildered by the noise, for all hands were
shouting at him; he jumped to his feet, and ran
round and round his master, as if asking what
was wanted of him.</p>

<p>Tim grew nervous, more especially as he saw
some of the boys who had appeared the most
frightened when the stone was first thrown now
smile, as if they were saying to themselves that
Tip couldn’t be so very much of a bear dog
after all, if he was afraid to kill one that had
been found for him.</p>

<p>Tim walked as near the bushes as he dared to
go, pointed with his finger, and urged Tip to
“go an’ bring him out,” but all to no purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
The dog seemed willing enough, but it was evident
he did not understand what was wanted
of him. Then Tim picked up a piece of wood,
and, after showing Tip that he was to follow it,
threw it in the direction of the supposed bear.</p>

<p>This time Tip understood, and he bounded
into the thicket, while each one of the party held
his breath in suspense, and grasped his weapons,
ready for immediate use.</p>

<p>The moment Tip was hidden by the bushes he
began to bark furiously, and there was no doubt
but that the battle had commenced. Even Bill
Thompson appeared to be a little timid, and he
no longer advised a rush, even though there was
a chance that the skin was being destroyed.
However, he did suggest that Tim and Bobby
should go in and put a rope around Tip’s neck,
so that he could be pulled away as soon as the
bear was dead; but his advice was not taken,
nor did there seem any chance that it would be.</p>

<p>Once Bobby took deliberate aim in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
of the noise made by Tip, and was just
lighting a match to discharge the weapon when
Tim stayed his murderous hand.</p>

<p>“You might kill Tip, an’ then we’d have
to fight the bear all by ourselves, ’cause Tip must
have bit him some by this time an’ made him
mad.”</p>

<p>No suggestion could have been made which
would have stopped Bobby quicker, and he
turned very pale at the thought of being deprived
of Tip’s protection, dropping his gun
very quickly.</p>

<p>Just at this time, when all were growing nervous
and excited, the sounds in the bushes told
that the beast was at last being driven from its
lair. Quite a number of the party lost all interest
in the matter when they found they were to
have a full view, and immediately retreated to
a safe distance.</p>

<p>But Bill, Tim, and Bobby held a portion of
their ground manfully, knowing they would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
in deepest disgrace if they, the leaders of the
party, should make any undignified flight. However,
they thought their dignity would not suffer
to any great extent if they should hide behind
a tree, and they did so at once.</p>

<p>The crackling and crashing of the bushes told
that some large animal was being driven out by
Tip; and as they watched in breathless—perhaps
frightened—anxiety one of the causes of the
commotion stalked out into view, while at the
same time an exclamation of disgust and relief
burst from Bill Thompson’s lips:</p>

<p>“Gracious! it’s only Bobby Tucker’s cow!”</p>

<p>And so it was. The bear had turned into a
peaceful, rather sleepy-looking old cow, who had
sought the shade of the bushes, only to be driven
from her cool retreat by Tip Babbige and a lot
of noisy boys.</p>

<p>How brave they all were then, and how they
laughed at each other’s cowardice, declaring that
they had only feared it might not be a bear after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
all! But they patted Tip’s head, and spoke to
him kindly, as if he had relieved them from some
terrible peril, instead of only disturbing a cow.</p>

<p>After the first excitement attending the finding
of the cow had subsided, the question arose
as to the proper course to pursue, and it was decided
that the bear-hunt must be continued, as
it would not be at all the right thing to delay
another day in nailing a skin to Bobby Tucker’s
father’s barn.</p>

<p>This time the march was not made with so
much caution, and Tip was allowed to roam
about loose, in the hope that he might find the
bear’s trail more quickly. Bobby even proposed
to shoot a squirrel; but this plan was quickly
frowned down by Bill Thompson, who reminded
him that he had no more powder, and that the
bear might come upon them at the very moment
when the gun was empty.</p>

<p>Tip ran on, joyous at having recovered his
freedom, and in a short time was out of sight.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
Then the boys ceased even to keep a lookout for
large animals, growing so careless as to watch
the squirrels, hunt for birds’ nests, and act in
every way unbecoming bear hunters.</p>

<p>But suddenly they were roused into activity
and excitement by furious, angry barking some
distance away.</p>

<p>“He’s caught one this time!” shouted Bill, as
he drew his knife from his belt and started forward
rapidly, followed closely or afar off by
the remainder of the party, according to their
degree of courage.</p>

<p>When the scene of the conflict was reached,
and it was positive that a fight was in progress,
because Tip’s barking had changed to short,
angry yelps, the greater portion of the party
found that they were too tired to run any farther,
and fell into such a slow pace that they
could not arrive until the battle was over.</p>

<p>“I can see them!” shouted Bill, exultantly;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
“an’ it ain’t a very big bear—only a small one.
Come on quick!”</p>

<p>As the leaders of the party dashed into a small
cleared space they saw Tip actually fighting,
and this time it was no cow, but a small, dark-colored
animal, which, if it really was a bear,
must have been a very young one.</p>

<p>Bill was not afraid of so small an animal, and
he jumped forward with his knife; but Tim
cried:</p>

<p>“It’s only a young one. Let’s get him away
from Tip, an’ take him home alive.”</p>

<p>He spoke too late to save the animal’s life,
for just then Tip gave the small bundle of fur
a toss in the air, and when it came down it was
dead.</p>

<p>Tim caught Tip by the neck, to prevent any
further attack on his part, and the boys gathered
around the victim. It was no bear, but a woodchuck,
Tip had killed, as they all knew after
a short examination, and the disappointment they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
felt at not having slain a bear was greatly lessened
by the fact that they had really killed
something.</p>

<p>How they praised and petted Tip then! Not
a boy among them, from that moment, but believed
he could have killed a bear as easily as
he had killed the woodchuck, and Tim was
happy.</p>

<p>That night there was a skin nailed on Bobby
Tucker’s father’s barn, but it was not a bearskin,
and it was wofully cut and hacked, owing
to Tip’s teeth and Bill Thompson’s very unscientific
skinning.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<small>BILL THOMPSON’S TENT.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Hardly had the boys ceased to talk of their
grand hunt when they were thrown into
the greatest excitement by news which Bill
Thompson had called them together to impart.
This is what he said, when at least a dozen were
present behind the same barn that had been ornamented
with the skin of Tip’s victim:</p>

<p>“Fellers, my father has jest brought home a
great big tent—a reg’lar canvas one—an’ he says
we may take it, an’ all go off campin’ for a week.
What do you think of that?”</p>

<p>For some moments it was impossible to learn
just what the boys did think of it, for they all
attempted to talk at once, and some, who could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
not speak as loud as the others, began to cheer,
until Tip—who, of course, had been called into
council with the others—barked loudly at the
confusion of sound. Although Bill knew that
his companions were almost beside themselves
with joy at the news, it was fully ten minutes
before the noise had subsided sufficiently for him
to learn that fact from their words.</p>

<p>Bobby Tucker was positive he and Tim would
be allowed to go with the party, because his
father had told them they might enjoy themselves
in their own way until the summer term
of school began, and the majority of those present
were equally certain they could go. Those
who had any doubts on the matter started off at
once to gain the desired permission, and in a
short time it was decided that just an even dozen—eleven
boys and Tip—would make up the
party. Then the serious work began.</p>

<p>It was necessary to decide where they should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
go, how they were to get there, and how a supply
of provisions could be obtained.</p>

<p>Bobby Tucker was sure he could get a bushel
of potatoes as his share, and a large piece of
pork as Tim’s. Bill Thompson owned three of
the hens in his father’s flock, one of which he
agreed to carry, in order that at least one “big”
dinner might be served, and he also agreed to
get three dozen of eggs. Jimmy Newcomb,
whose father kept a store, was certain he could
get a large supply of crackers and a small supply
of candy. Another of the party promised
butter, pepper, and salt; another agreed, in the
name of his mother, to have some gingerbread
and pies; and so the list of provisions was made
up, thus settling the last question first.</p>

<p>Where the camp should be pitched was a more
difficult matter to decide. Some were in favor
of going in the same direction as that taken on
the bear-hunt; but this was voted down at once
by Bill Thompson, who, because he was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
party furnishing the tent, had great weight in the
discussion.</p>

<p>“We want to go ’way off where we can’t get
back for a good while,” he said, decidedly. “An’,
besides, we must go where nobody lives, so’s we
can find more bears for Tip.”</p>

<p>Then another of the party suggested getting
a horse and cart, and going as far into the interior
of the island as possible; but this Bill
objected to, on the ground that they would then
be obliged to follow some road, which would
still keep them within the range of civilization.</p>

<p>“Can’t we get a boat, an’ go way round to
the other side of the island, where nobody lives?”
asked Tim.</p>

<p>“That’s the very thing,” said Bill, decisively—“that’s
the very thing, an’ Jimmy Newcomb can
get the one his father keeps at Dunham’s
wharf.”</p>

<p>All three of the questions having thus been
settled, the boys went over to Bill Thompson’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
to view the tent which was to afford them their
highest idea of enjoyment. It was found to be
quite large enough to shelter the entire party,
being fully twelve feet square, and complete in
everything save pegs and stakes, which could
easily be made before starting, or after they
should arrive on the spot where it was to be
pitched.</p>

<p>It was some time before the boys had gazed
sufficiently upon this canvas house, so wonderfully
come into their possession, and they would
probably have spent more time in admiration of
it, had there not been some little doubt as to
whether Jimmy Newcomb’s father had the same
idea regarding the loan of his boat as his son.</p>

<p>It was thought best to have an interview with
Mr. Newcomb at once, and the entire party
marched down the village to a point almost
opposite the store, and waited there while Jimmy
went in to ask the important question.</p>

<p>He remained inside so long that every boy’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
face commenced to grow sad, for each moment
he was there seemed to tell that he was not succeeding
in the project.</p>

<p>“I guess his father won’t let him have it, an’
he’s stayin’ there to coax,” said Bill, sadly; but
he had hardly spoken when Jimmy appeared.
He could not wait until he crossed the street before
he imparted the joyful news, but waved his
hat even while he stood on the threshold of the
door, and shouted, at the highest squeak of his
voice:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, boys; we can have her as long
as we want, if we’re careful not to get her stove
up.”</p>

<p>In the twinkling of an eye every one of those
boys had started at full speed toward Dunham’s
wharf, that they might look at the craft which
was to carry them on their journey. They had
all seen the boat at least a hundred times before,
but now that she was theirs for a while she
seemed like a new one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>Since the boat was ready, and the tent nearly
complete for pitching, Bill Thompson proposed
that each one should spend that day getting ready
for the trip. The time set for the start was
seven o’clock on the following morning, and
every one was expected to be on hand promptly
at that hour. Tim, Bobby, and Bill promised
to make the tent pegs and stakes, and it was decided
that, if any important question should
come up meanwhile, they should meet behind
Bobby Tucker’s barn that night to discuss it.</p>

<p>With this agreement the conference broke up,
and during the remainder of that day, when any
of the townspeople saw a boy running at full
speed, or staggering under a load of bed-clothing,
they knew he was one of the party who were
going out camping for a week.</p>

<p>It would not be surprising if the mothers of
those boys lost their temper several times during
the following ten hours, so numerous were their
wants, and such vague ideas did they have as to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
the amount of provisions necessary for a week’s
stay in the woods. But, greatly to the delight
of both the boys and their parents, the day came
to a close, as all days will, and a very happy
party met in the rear of Mr. Tucker’s barn.</p>

<p>Each one had secured the articles promised,
while some had been able to do even more.
Bobby had found a flag, rather the worse for
wear, to be sure, but still showing enough of
the Stars and Stripes to allow one to see what
it had been, and this was looked upon as the
crowning triumph of all.</p>

<p>Tim, Bobby, and Bill had worked hard at the
tent pegs, but had made only about half the required
number. This, however, was not considered
important, since the remainder could
be made after they arrived at the camping-place.</p>

<p>When the party broke up that night it was
with the understanding that each one would be
at the boat as early as possible, and it was hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
work for any of them to get to sleep that night.
But nearly all of them were up and dressed before
the sun had any idea that it was time for
him to show his face in the east.</p>

<p>It was hardly half-past six when everything,
from the tent to Bill Thompson’s live hen, was
in the boat, packed snugly. The flag was raised
at the stern of a thin slab of drift-wood, held
in place by Jimmy Newcomb, who was given
the position of helmsman, owing to the fact that
his father owned the boat. The remainder of
the party were to take turns at rowing, and when
the boat was pushed away from the shore, four
oars were worked as vigorously as the boys at
the end of them knew how.</p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="i_fp136">

  <figcaption class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_161">MAKING READY TO EMBARK</a></p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Bill Thompson started a song, in which all
joined; Tip barked until there was danger that
he would become hopelessly hoarse; and the old
hen cackled and scolded, as if she knew just what
her fate was to be.</p>

<p>There was only one settlement on Minchin’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
Island, and it was the plan of the party to row
around the coast until they reached a point as
nearly opposite the village as possible. The
distance was fully ten miles; but no one thought
the labor would be too great if, by dint of hard
rowing, they could reach a place that was uninhabited,
and each was ready to take his turn
at the oar whenever another was tired.</p>

<p>Now, Bill Thompson was a great stickler for
discipline; and although he had said nothing
about it when the details of the voyage were
under discussion, he had a plan which he began
to carry into execution as soon as the journey
was fairly commenced.</p>

<p>“Now, we’ve got to do this thing right,” he
said, as he braced himself in the bow, where he
could have a view of all hands. “We must choose
different ones to do different things, so’s we’ll
know what we’re about. We’ve got to have
cooks, an’ I nom’nate Tim Babbige an’ Bobby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
Tucker to take care of the victuals an’ do the
cookin’.”</p>

<p>Bill paused, as if for some one to second the
proposition, and Jimmy Newcomb said—not
very properly, to be sure, according to the rules
laid down for the election of gentlemen to office,
but still quite emphatically enough to show
he meant it—</p>

<p>“That settles it;” and Tim and Bobby were
considered elected to the responsible offices of
cooks and guardians of the food.</p>

<p>“Now, I go in for makin’ Jimmy Newcomb
captain of the ship, an’ he must boss the job when
we’re out on a trip, an’ when we’re landin’.”</p>

<p>This time Tim, being already one of the most
important officers of the expedition, considering
it necessary to assist in the election of some of
the others, said, quickly:</p>

<p>“That’s jest the thing.”</p>

<p>After Bill had appointed certain of the boys
to cut wood and bring water, he said, with just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
a shade of hesitation in his voice, as if he was
troubled with bashfulness:</p>

<p>“Now somebody’s got to be captain of the
huntin’, an’ if you boys are willin’ I’ll do that;
an’ whatever kind of wild animals we scare up,
I promise to be the first one to rush in an’ cut
their throats after Tip has caught ’em.”</p>

<p>This was considered as a sort of oath of office,
and each member of the party made some sign
of agreement in Bill’s self-election, feeling perfectly
satisfied that he should fill what was looked
upon as a dangerous position.</p>

<p>After they had rowed at least three hours, different
members of the crew insisted that they
must have gone entirely around the island, and
were then proceeding toward home; but Jimmy
quickly put a stop to any grumbling. Both he
and Bill knew when they were about opposite
the village, for they had been there several times
with Captain Thompson, and they were both
equally positive that they had yet some miles to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
go before gaining the extreme end of the island.</p>

<p>It was about eleven o’clock, and nearly every
boy was tired out with his work at the oar, when
Jimmy ordered them to stop rowing, and pointed
inshore.</p>

<p>The view which presented itself was a lovely
one. Two points of rock projected some distance
into the sea, forming a little harbor, at
the head of which was a smooth, shelving beach
of sand. Just back of the beach was a dense
grove of pine-trees, and through them led a
narrow path, now so covered with vines and
weeds as to show it had not been used, by man
at least, for some time.</p>

<p>Jim had no need to ask what his companions
thought of camping there, for each one appeared
delighted with it, and the boat was headed for
the beach.</p>

<p>Bill Thompson was the first to leap ashore,
and, though he was only the chief huntsman, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
assumed full charge of the expedition, so far as
landing and setting up the tent were concerned.</p>

<p>A cleared spot in the grove about fifty yards
from the beach was selected as the site of the
tent, and they then wished that the pegs had all
been made before they started, for the canvas
could not be put up till that was done. Bill
and two others set about this important work,
while Tim and Bobby bustled around to get
something to eat, and Jim made sure the boat was
anchored securely.</p>

<p>The first thing done by the two cooks was to
tie Bill’s hen by her leg to a tree, and then it
was found necessary to fasten Tip some distance
from her, since he showed a decided inclination
to treat her as he had the woodchuck.</p>

<p>Then the more skilful work of building the
fireplace was begun, and this Tim took charge
of, while Bobby unpacked the kettle and spider,
got the potatoes ready for cooking and made
himself generally useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>Tim made rather a good job of the fireplace,
and after he had finished it to his satisfaction he
cut three forked sticks, on which to hang the kettle,
but immediately afterward found that they
had forgotten to bring a chain, and would be
obliged to suspend the pot by a rope, thereby
running some risk of its burning.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the wood and water carriers had
done their part of the work, and the cooks found
plenty of material close at hand for beginning
their culinary operations. The potatoes were
put on to boil, and, thanks to the generous fire
underneath them, gave promise of speedily being
ready to do their allotted duty in the dinner
which the hungry boys were anxiously expecting.</p>

<p>Bill had finished making his tent pegs, and
by the time Tim had succeeded in hanging the
kettle the tent was up, needing only the delicate
operation of setting the stakes properly to make
it a large and habitable dwelling.</p>

<small>ONE COOK SPOILS THE BROTH.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The question of what was to make up the
dinner bill of fare appeared to be an important
one to all, and many were the suggestions
made to the cooks. Some proposed that
the work of raising the tent be intrusted to other
hands, so that Bill and Tip could go out and
bring in a deer or a bear; others thought the old
hen should be killed at once, and served up as
a roast; while one portion of the party seemed to
think it Captain Jimmy’s duty to get his ship
under way and go after some fish for a chowder.</p>

<p>But Tim and Bobby did not allow any of
these remarks to trouble them; they were the
legally elected cooks, and they proposed to do
the work in their own way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll get the dinner,” said Tim, with some
dignity; “an’ after it’s done, if you fellers don’t
like it, you can cook one to suit yourselves.”</p>

<p>But the cooks did listen to what Bill had to
say, since he was one of the high officials, and
he was strongly in favor of making the first dinner
in camp a “big” one, even going so far as to
propose in all earnestness that the hen be killed.</p>

<p>“We might jest as well eat her,” he said, as
he looked murderously toward the unhappy
fowl, which was struggling to free herself from
her bonds at the risk of breaking her leg.
“’Cause jest as likely as not she’ll get away, an’
then we sha’n’t so much as have a smell of her.”</p>

<p>“It will take us too long to fix her up for
dinner,” said Tim, who was just the least bit
afraid that he was not cook enough to serve the
hen properly, “We can get enough to eat to-day
without havin’ so much fuss.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care how long it takes; what we want<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
is a bang-up dinner, an’ I go in for havin’ it
now,” said Bill, decidedly.</p>

<p>Bobby was on the point of throwing the weight
of his opinion against the proposed feast when a
bark of triumph was heard from Tip, and the
question was settled without farther discussion.
The dog, which had been struggling to get free
from the time he had been tied so near the hen,
to which he seemed to think he had a perfect
right, finally succeeded in releasing himself.
There was a sudden rush on his part, a loud,
cackling protest from poor Biddy, who seemed
to anticipate her fate, and then she was tossed in
the air a dead chicken.</p>

<p>Bill had presence of mind enough, fortunately
for the dinner prospects, to seize his hen before
Tip made his lunch from her, and he said, as he
handed her to Tim:</p>

<p>“There, you see Tip knew we ought to kill
her, an’ so he did it for us. Now we can have a
good dinner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>Tim made no reply, and perhaps for the first
time in his life he was angry with Tip for having
meddled in matters which did not concern him.
It was necessary now to cook the hen, and as he
stood with her in his hand the terrible thought
came to him that he did not even know enough
to prepare her for cooking.</p>

<p>“Do you think we had better have her roasted
or boiled?” he asked, in a low tone, of Bobby.</p>

<p>Now, this other cook was quite as perplexed
about the matter as Tim was, and he was thoroughly
well pleased that he had allowed his partner
to take the lead in other matters, so that the
latter would now be obliged to take all the responsibility
of the hen’s appearance at the
dinner-table.</p>

<p>“I think we had better roast her,” he said, in
a careless sort of way, as if to him one style of
cooking was as easy as another.</p>

<p>Again was Tim disappointed. He had hoped
Bobby would propose boiling her, in which case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
all he would be obliged to do would be to pop
her into the kettle, letting her stay there until
she was done. But since Bobby was so cruel as
to propose the hardest way of cooking the hen,
roasted it must be, or gone was his reputation
as cook.</p>

<p>“I’ll pick the feathers off,” said Bill, gleefully;
and Tim handed him the fowl.</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to see how we’re goin’ to get
along,” said Tim to Bobby. “We ain’t got any
dishes to cook her in.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want any, do we?” asked his assistant,
in some surprise. “I always thought when
folks that were campin’ out cooked anything they
stuck it on a stick in front of the fire, an’ let it
sizzle.”</p>

<p>“We can do it so now!” he exclaimed; and,
since this suggestion had been made, roasting
chickens did not appear to be any very hard matter
after all.</p>

<p>He piled the wood on until he had a fire large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
enough to roast a pig, cut a long, sharp stick on
which to spit the hen, and had hardly completed
these preparations when Bill Thompson reappeared
with the now featherless victim of
Tip’s bloodthirsty nature.</p>

<p>Bill’s work might have been done more neatly;
but what did a few feathers amount to when a
dozen hungry boys were waiting to be fed? Tim
was not quite sure whether he had better cut off
the head and legs, or not; but, as they did not
seem to be in the way, he concluded they might
as well be cooked. Neither did he think any
cleaning necessary, but plunged the stick through
her, and stuck one end in the ground in front
of the fire with all the grace of an experienced
cook.</p>

<p>The remainder of the party watched this work
with hungry eagerness; and when Tim filled the
kettle with potatoes they settled themselves down
contentedly to wait for the “bang-up” dinner for
which they were in a measure indebted to Tip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>The water in the pot bubbled and boiled merrily;
the murdered hen began to steam and sizzle,
till every boy’s mouth watered with anticipation;
while Tim and Bobby bustled around in an
important manner, feeling that they were looked
up to as the head men of the party, and enjoying
the distinction immensely.</p>

<p>They piled on the wood, stirred the potatoes,
as if that was the important part of cooking that
vegetable, while every few moments Tim would
smell of the hen, nearly singeing the hair from
his head each time. They were certainly good
cooks, if keeping up a big fire could make them
so.</p>

<p>The hen did not appear to be revengeful at
having been so suddenly deprived of life, for
in a short time her rather lean body began to
turn brown, and a most delicious odor arose on
the air, even if she was thickly incrusted with
ashes.</p>

<p>As Tim turned her carefully he thought with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
surprise that he was a really good cook, and
blamed himself for having been so distrustful of
his own ability.</p>

<p>Thus matters went on, successfully but slowly,
until some of the boys showed such plain signs
of impatience that Tim thought it necessary to
display more evidences of the dinner, even
though the hen was far from being roasted.</p>

<p>He and Bobby selected from the cooked provisions
enough in the way of pies and cake to
make twice as large a party feel very uncomfortable.
They spread this feast at one side of
the fire, where it would be out of the way of
the smoke, and Tim was trying to calculate how
it would be possible to cut an apple pie in eleven
pieces, and have them all of equal size, when
a sound as of water coming in contact with fire,
accompanied by a cry of dismay from Bill
Thompson, caused him to start violently.</p>

<p>The sight that met his startled gaze was a
sad one, and it did not seem any less so to him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
than it did to all the others of that hungry
party.</p>

<p>The kettle of potatoes had been hung to the
poles by a rope, which had burnt slowly until it
broke, letting the potatoes, water, and kettle into
the fire, deluging the half-roasted hen, and basting
it with cinders until it looked like a huge
ball of mud.</p>

<p>The steam and smoke were so dense that it
was impossible to attempt a rescue. All that
could be done was to wait a few moments, and
Tim spent that time dancing around the ruins
like a crazy Indian.</p>

<p>It was a horror-stricken party that stood
around the drowned fire, watching the cooks as
they fished up first the muddy hen, and then the
potatoes, all looking very sorry for their plunge
into the ashes.</p>

<p>“Now all you’ve got to do,” said Bill Thompson,
with the air of one who knew, “is to put the
potatoes right back an’ wash the hen. They’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
cook jest as well as ever, only it’ll take a little
longer, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Surely there was nothing so serious about the
accident if it could be repaired with so little
trouble, and the spirits of the party rose as
rapidly as they had fallen. The hen was given a
sea bath, which took nearly all the ashes off,
and those which remained, Bill Thompson
thought, would make her taste the better. The
potatoes did not need any cleansing, so Tim
thought, and were put into the pot again, looking
quite dirty, but in very nearly a cooked
condition.</p>

<p>Another fire was built, and rocks were placed
in such a way around it that the kettle could rest
on them. The hen was put on another stick,
and again the chances for dinner looked
promising.</p>

<p>The food which had been spread out on the
ground looked very tempting to the idle ones of
the hungry party, and every now and then one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
would try to get a piece of pie or cake, until Tim,
who was determined that no one should have
anything to eat until all could be served, was
almost at his wits’ end to prevent them from
making a perfect raid on the larder.</p>

<p>Finally, worn out with running from the fire
to the table every time he saw one of the party
moving innocently up that way, he told Bobby
to keep strict guard over the food, and that young
gentleman wiped the ashes and perspiration from
his face with an air of relief, as he seated himself
near the largest pie, prepared to act the part of
watch-dog.</p>

<p>Tip, who had been running about in everybody’s
way, and seriously troubling his master,
now came toward the fire, and sat down on his
little stubbed tail in such a suspicious manner
that Tim felt reasonably certain it was his purpose
to steal the hen whenever a good opportunity
presented itself.</p>

<p>Such base action on Tip’s part caused Tim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
more delay, as he was obliged to tie the dog securely
to a tree out of reach of temptation, and
by the time the tired cook got back to his work
again a great commotion was raised by Captain
Jimmy and Bobby.</p>

<p>When Bill Thompson had quelled the tumult
it was learned that Captain Jim doubted Bobby’s
honesty from the first moment he had been appointed
guardian of the food, and had watched
him from behind a tree. He stated positively
that he saw Bobby’s eyes fixed on the apple-pie
in such a way as no officer of the company should
look at a pie, unless the time had come to eat it,
and, at a time when he thought no one was looking,
Jim was sure he saw him put his fingers
under the crust, pull out two slices of apple, and
eat them.</p>

<p>Of course such a charge as this caused intense
excitement, and the majority of the party thought
Bobby ought to be punished in some way, as a
warning to others, and more especially to show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
that the officers of the party should be above
reproach, or, failing in their duty, be punished
severely.</p>

<p>Bobby actually grew frightened as his companions
discussed the question of his punishment,
and he looked imploringly at Tim, thinking
his brother-officer should try to shield him
in his crime of stealing the pie. But there was
no pity to be seen in the head cook’s face; he
felt that the taking of those two pieces of apple
by the man who had been appointed to guard
them was indeed a crime.</p>

<p>Some of the party proposed that the culprit
be condemned to go without his dinner; others,
not quite so bloodthirsty, believed he should be
deprived of his office, while there were those
who believed that to forbid him eating any pie
would be punishment enough.</p>

<p>It is hard to say just how Bobby would have
been obliged to atone for the sin, if the hand of
Justice had not been stayed by the dinner itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>The chicken was becoming blackened and
burnt on one side, from not being turned often
enough, the potatoes were boiling into a perfect
jelly, and it was all being done so quickly that
Tim had not the time to attend to the food properly;
therefore it was he who saved his assistant
from his judges.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to let him go this time, for he
must help me,” he said. “We’ll make him work
all the harder to pay for what he’s done.”</p>

<p>Once more over the smoky fire and amid the
flying ashes Bobby labored for the good of
others, working out the punishment for his sin.</p>

<p>The kettle of potatoes was taken from the fire;
and while Bobby picked out the pieces—for they
had boiled until they were discouraged, and had
burst their skins—arranging them on two
shingles, Tim took the well-blackened remains
of poor Biddy from the spit, laying them on a
short bit of board in great triumph.</p>

<p>Then the hungry party gathered around the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
place which represented the table, and waited
impatiently to be served.</p>

<p>Bill Thompson, with his hunting-knife, proceeded
to carve the fowl, which was a work of
some time, owing to its exceeding toughness.</p>

<p>In order to show proper respect for the office
he held, Bill waited on Captain Jimmy first, and
that young gentleman did not waste much time
before he began to eat.</p>

<p>The roast was quite raw inside, even though
it was burnt outside, but that, in Captain Jimmy’s
hungry condition, made very little difference.
He cut off the first mouthful and began to eat
in a ravenous manner, when suddenly he
stopped, looking very queer.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Tim, anxiously,
quick to notice the change in the captain’s face.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” said Jim; “but it tastes kind o’
funny.”</p>

<p>“That’s ’cause you ain’t used to hen,” said Bill,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
almost savagely, not pleased that any one should
find fault with his fowl.</p>

<p>Just then another of the party, who had received
his portion and begun eating, laid down
his knife and fork with an unmistakable air of
discomfort.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you don’t like hen,” cried Bill, now
growing angry that food of his providing should
be refused.</p>

<p>By this time several of the party had shown
unmistakable signs of disliking the roast, and
Bill proceeded to make an investigation.</p>

<p>He cut off a large mouthful, and began eating
it with the air of one who thinks he knows just
what he is about to taste, and has made up his
mind beforehand to be pleased. But he stopped
as suddenly as the others had, and looking sternly
at Tim, he asked:</p>

<p>“What did you put on this hen?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’; perhaps it tastes queer ’cause the
’taters tipped over on it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>“It don’t taste like ’taters,” said Bill; “it tastes
a good deal worse.”</p>

<p>Then he examined the uncarved portion of
the fowl, and the mystery was explained.</p>

<p>“I know what the matter is, an’ I don’t think
you’re much of a cook, Tim Babbige. You’ve
cooked the hen without cleanin’ her, an’ of course
she’s spoiled.”</p>

<p>Tim could make no reply, for as soon as Bill
spoke he remembered how chickens ought to
look when ready to be roasted, and he knew he
could no longer hope to be considered a competent
cook.</p>

<p>That day the party made their dinner of boiled
potatoes and pastry, while Tip actually revelled
on the half-roasted fowl he had so ruthlessly
slain.</p>

<small>TIP’S DANGER.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The work of preparing the dinner had occupied
so much time that it was nearly
the regular hour for supper before the last boy
arose from the lowly table, and not one of them
had any desire to fish or hunt. They sat around
the fire, dodging the smoke as best they could,
until the setting sun warned them that they must
get their bedroom work done at once, or be
obliged to do it in the dark.</p>

<p>This task was remarkably simple; it consisted
in each boy finding his blanket, wrapping himself
in it, and lying on the ground, all in a row,
like herrings in a box.</p>

<p>Nor did they wait very long for slumber to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
visit their eyelids, for in ten minutes after they
were ready it came to all, even to Tip, who had
curled himself up snugly under Tim’s arm.</p>

<p>Had any of the party been experienced in the
sport of “camping out,” they would have studied
the signs in the sky, for the purpose of learning
what might have been expected of the weather;
but as it was, they had all laid themselves down
to sleep without a thought that the dark clouds
which had begun to gather in the sky were evidences
of a storm.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight, and up to that time
not one of them had awakened from the heavy
sleep into which he had first fallen, when Tim
became painfully aware that something was
wrong. He had been dreaming that he was
again on the <i>Pride of the Wave</i>, that Captain
Pratt had thrown him overboard because he had
been trying to steer, and just as he struck the
water he awoke, with a start.</p>

<p>The moment his eyes were open he understood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
the reason for his dream: he was lying in
a large pool of water, and the blanket in which
he had wrapped himself so comfortably was
thoroughly saturated with it. At first he was at
a loss to account for this sudden change of condition,
and then the loud patter of rain on the
canvas roof told the story plainly. A storm had
come up, and the tent, being on the slope of a
hill, was serving as a sort of reservoir for little
streams of water that were rapidly increasing
in size.</p>

<p>Tip, roused by his master’s sudden movement,
had started from his comfortable position and
walked directly into the water, very much to his
discomfort and fear; howling loudly, he jumped
among the sleepers with such force as at once
to awaken and terrify them.</p>

<p>It required but a few words from Tim to make
them understand all that had happened, for some
of them were nearly as wet as he was, and all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
could hear the patter of the rain, which seemed
to increase in violence each moment.</p>

<p>A lonesome prospect it was to think of remaining
in the tent the rest of the night, unable
to sleep because of the water that poured in
under the canvas, or trickled down through three
or four small holes in the roof.</p>

<p>For several moments none of them knew what
to do, but they stood huddled together in sleepy
surprise and sorrow, until Tim proposed that,
since he could hardly be more wet than he was,
he should go out and dig a trench which would
lead the water each side of the tent. But that
plan was abandoned when it was discovered
that a hatchet and a spoon were the only effective
tools they had.</p>

<p>In order to get some idea of the condition of
affairs, Tim lighted first one match and then
another; but the light shed was so feeble that
Captain Jimmy proposed building a small fire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
which would both illuminate and heat the interior.</p>

<p>Tim acted upon this suggestion at once. With
some newspapers and small bits of wood that
were still dry he succeeded in kindling such a
blaze as shed quite a light, but did not endanger
the canvas. But he forgot all about the smoke,
and this oversight he was reminded of very
forcibly after a few moments.</p>

<p>Careful examination showed that the water
only came in from the upper or higher side of
the tent, but it was pouring in there in such quantities
that before long the interior would be
spread with a carpet of water.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to dig a ditch along this side, so’s
the water will run off,” said Tim, after he
had surveyed the uncomfortable-looking little
brooks, and waited a moment, in the hope that
Bill or Captain Jimmy would suggest a better
plan.</p>

<p>All saw the necessity of doing something at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
once, and the moment Tim gave them the idea
they went to work with knives, spoons, or any
other implements they could find. It did not
take much time, even with the poor tools they
had, to dig a trench that would carry away any
moderate amount of water, and after that was
done they gathered around the fire for consultation.</p>

<p>But by that time they began to learn that
smoke was even more uncomfortable to bear than
water. For some time it had been rising to the
top of the tent, escaping in small quantities
through the flaps and holes; but only a portion
of it had found vent, and the tent was so full
that they were nearly suffocated.</p>

<p>They covered their eyes, and tried to “grin
and bear it”; but such heroic effort could only be
made for a short while, and they were obliged
to run out into the pelting rain in order to get
the pure air.</p>

<p>It was no fun to stand out-of-doors in a storm,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
and, acting on Captain Jimmy’s suggestion, the
party returned after a few moments to “kick the
fire out.”</p>

<p>But such a plan was of very little benefit, since
the embers would smoke despite all they could
do, and out they ran again, seeking such shelter
as they could find under the trees, where it was
not long before they came to the conclusion that
camping out in a rain-storm was both a delusion
and a snare.</p>

<p>In half an hour the tent was so nearly freed
from smoke that they sought its shelter again,
and when they were housed once more they presented
a very forlorn appearance.</p>

<p>At first they decided that they would remain
awake until daylight; but as the hours rolled
on this plan was abandoned, for one after another
wrapped himself in his blanket, concluding
he could keep his eyes open as well lying
down, and proved it by going to sleep at once.</p>

<p>They did not sleep very soundly, nor lie in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
bed very late. When they awakened it was not
necessary to look out-of-doors in order to know
if it was raining, for the water was falling on
the thin shelter as hard and as persistently as if
bent on beating it down.</p>

<p>There was but one happy-looking face among
all the party, and that belonged to Tim. He
realized that it would be impossible to do much
cooking while it was storming, and after his experience
with the hen he had no desire to begin
again his official duties.</p>

<p>As soon as the boys were fairly out of bed they
began to ask how breakfast could be cooked, and
what they were to have in the way of food, all
of which questions Tim answered in a way that
left no chance for discussion. He cut eleven
slices of bread, spread them thickly with butter,
placed over that a slice of cake, and informed
the party that they would begin the day with
just that sort of a breakfast.</p>

<p>Of course there was some grumbling, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
dissatisfied ones soon realized that Tim had done
his best under the circumstances, and they ate
the bread and cake very contentedly.</p>

<p>That forenoon was not spent in a very jolly
manner; no one could go out save at the risk of
a thorough wetting, and when dinner, consisting
of the same as was given for breakfast, was
served, they began to consider themselves an
injured party.</p>

<p>That afternoon was a repetition of the forenoon,
save that at supper-time Tim gravely informed
them that there was hardly enough
cooked provisions for breakfast.</p>

<p>Tip got along much better than the others.
As soon as he learned that he could not venture
outside of the tent without getting wet, he curled
himself up on the pile of blankets and slept the
day away, save at those times when some one
would rouse him up to play—a liberty which he
resented in such a manner as caused them to
leave him alone very soon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>Nearly every five minutes some one of the
boys would open the flaps of the tent, look out,
and announce it as his opinion that the storm
was clearing away; but yet it continued to rain
as hard as ever.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, the boys were not as
sleepy when the second night came, and the evening
spent in the dark was not a cheerful one.
The rain was still coming down as steadily as
ever, and they had ceased to speculate as to when
it would stop. It was after they had been sitting
in mournful silence for some time that Bill
Thompson started what was a painful topic of
conversation.</p>

<p>“How long will the victuals last, Tim?”</p>

<p>“They’re ’most gone now, ’cept the pork an’
’taters, an’ the eggs, that I never thought of till
a minute ago.”</p>

<p>“If it would only stop rainin’, Jim could go
out fishin’, an’ I could go out huntin’, and in a
day we could get more’n the crowd of us could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
eat in a week. I’ll tell you what I will do”—and
Bill spoke very earnestly—“I’ll take Tip an’
go out alone in the mornin’, whether it rains or
not.”</p>

<p>“Why not all go?” said Tim, pleased with the
plan. “Supposin’ we do get wet, what of that?
We can get dry again when the sun does come
out, an’ it’ll be better’n stayin’ here scrouchin’
around.”</p>

<p>There were a number of the boys who were
of Tim’s way of thinking, and the hunting party
was decided upon for the following day, regardless
of the weather.</p>

<p>That night seemed a long one, and when the
morning came each one looked anxiously out
at the sky, gaining but little comfort from the
view. The clouds were dull and gray; and
though the rain was not falling as furiously as
it had been, it was still coming down in the same
determined way.</p>

<p>Tim made an addition to the rather small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
slices of bread and cake, in the shape of two raw
eggs to each boy; and though some of them rebelled
at the uncooked food, they were wise
enough to suck them before they grumbled very
loudly.</p>

<p>After breakfast some of the boys who had been
the most determined to join the hunting party
the night before, concluded to wait a while
longer before setting out, and the consequence
was that no one save Tim, Bill, and Bobby had
the courage to brave the drenching which it was
certain they must get.</p>

<p>This time Bill had a more effective weapon
than the one he used at the bear hunt. He had
borrowed a fowling-piece of quite a respectable
size, and had brought with him a supply of
powder and shot.</p>

<p>When Tip was called to join the party he
did not display the animation usual with him
when invited out for a day’s sport, and Tim
blamed him severely for it. But he went, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
and Tim’s scolding seemed to have very
little effect upon him.</p>

<p>Believing they should come back staggering
under the weight of game which Tip would find
and Bill would kill, the boys left the tent, going
up the path, since they did not dare to strike
through the thickest part of the woods, for fear
of getting lost.</p>

<p>Bill covered the lock of the gun with the corner
of his jacket, to prevent the cap from getting
wet, and on they went, rapidly getting a drenching
both from the rain and the water which came
from the branches of the trees.</p>

<p>For some time Tip steadily refused to run
among the bushes, but after much urging he did
consent to hunt in a listless sort of way, barking
once or twice at some squirrels that had come out
of their holes to grumble at the weather, but
scaring up no larger game.</p>

<p>Just at a time when the hunters were getting
discouraged by their ill-luck, Tip commenced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
barking at a furious rate, and started off through
the bushes at full speed.</p>

<p>Bill was all excitement; he made up his mind
that they were on the track of a deer at last, and
was ready to discharge his weapon at the first
moving object he should see.</p>

<p>After running five minutes, during which time
they made very little progress, owing to the
density of the woods, Bobby halted suddenly
and, in an excited manner, pointed toward a
dark object some distance ahead, which could
be but dimly seen because of the foliage.</p>

<p>Bill was on his knee in an instant, with gun
raised, and just as he was about to pull the trigger
Tim saw the object that had attracted
Bobby’s attention.</p>

<p>He cried out sharply, and started toward Bill
to prevent him from firing, but was too late.
Almost as he spoke the gun was discharged, and
mingled with Tim’s cries could be heard the
howling of a dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve shot Tip! you’ve shot Tip!” cried
Tim, in an agony of grief, as he rushed forward,
followed by Bill and Bobby, looking as terrified
as though they had shot one of their companions.</p>

<p>When Tim reached the spot from which the
cries of pain came he found that his fears were
not groundless, for there on the wet leaves,
bathed in his own blood, that flowed from shot-wounds
on his back and hind-legs, was poor Tip.
He was trying to bite the wounds that burnt,
and all the while uttering sharp yelps of distress.</p>

<p>Tim, with a whole heart full of sorrow such
as he had never known before, knelt by the poor
dog’s side, kissing him tenderly, but powerless
to do anything for his suffering pet save to wipe
the blood away. His grief was too great to
admit of his saying anything to the unfortunate
hunter who had done him so much mischief,
and poor Bill stood behind a tree crying as if
his heart was breaking.</p>

<p>Each instant Tim expected to see Tip in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
death struggle, and he tried very hard to make
the dog kiss him; but the poor animal was in
such pain that he had no look even for his master.</p>

<p>It was nearly fifteen minutes that the three
were gathered around the dog expecting to see
him die, and then he appeared to be in less pain.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he won’t die after all,” said Bill,
hardly even daring to hope his words would
prove true. “If we could only get home Dr.
Abbott would cure him.” Then, as a sudden
thought came to him, he turned quickly to
Bobby, and said, eagerly: “Run back to the
camp as quick as you can, an’ tell the fellers
what has happened. Have them get everything
into the boat, so’s we can get right away for
home.”</p>

<p>Bobby started off at full speed, and Tim, now
encouraged to think that Tip might yet recover,
began to look hopeful.</p>

<p>Bill set to work cutting down some small
saplings, out of which he made a very good litter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
On this Tip was placed tenderly, and, with Bill
at one end and Tim at the other, they started
down the path toward the camp. To avoid jolting
the dog, thus causing him more pain, they
were obliged to walk so slowly that when they
reached the beach the boys were putting into
the boat the last of their camp equipage.</p>

<p>Each of the party wanted to examine poor
Tip, but Bill would not permit it, because of
the delay it would cause. He arranged a comfortable
place in the bow where Tip could lie,
and another where Tim could sit beside him,
working all the time as if each moment was of
the greatest importance in the saving of Tip’s
life.</p>

<p>At last all was ready, the word was given to
push off, and the campers rowed swiftly toward
home.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_XIII"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIII.</span><br>
<small>IN CONCLUSION.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Every one knew that Tip’s life depended
on their getting home quickly, and all the
strength they could command was expended on
the oars to such purpose that in a trifle more
than two hours the boat was moored alongside
Dunham’s wharf again.</p>

<p>Without stopping for anything, the entire
party followed Tim and Bill to Dr. Abbott’s
office, and there they could hardly prevent themselves
from cheering when the doctor told them
that Tip’s injuries were by no means serious, and
that he would soon be well, although it was possible
that he might always be lame in one hind-leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>The shots were soon extracted, and Tip taken
to the most comfortable spot in Mr. Tucker’s
barn, where it is safe to say he did not suffer
from want of attention.</p>

<p>That night, after Bobby and Tim had told the
story of their camping-out, Mr. Tucker thoroughly
frightened them by saying that on the
next day he was going to take Tim back to Selman,
to see Captain Babbige.</p>

<p>Tim’s face grew very pale, and it was plain
to be seen that he was in the greatest terror, while
Bobby was thrown into a perfect fever of excitement.</p>

<p>“I am not going to leave you there, Tim, if I
can help it, for I intend to do by you as I would
some one should do by my Bobby if I had been
called to meet the Great Father. As matters
now stand, you have no right to be here, nor I
to keep you; for Captain Babbige is your lawful
guardian, whom I hope you did not leave without
sufficient cause. To-morrow night we will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
start for Selman, and there the law shall decide
whether you may not be permitted to choose
another guardian.”</p>

<p>Bobby caught eagerly at the idea that Tim
would soon return, with a perfect right to stay
on Minchin’s Island; but the homeless boy took
a more gloomy view of the case. He felt certain
that Captain Babbige would force him to
remain with him, and the future now looked as
dark as a day or two before it had looked bright.</p>

<p>So positive did he feel that he should not be
allowed to return that if Tip’s wound had been
any less severe he would have taken him with
him; but as it was he made Bobby promise faithfully
to send him as soon as he should be able
to travel.</p>

<p>The next day, when the boy population of
Minchin’s Island learned that Tim was to be
taken back to the man who had abused him so
cruelly, they held a sort of indignation meeting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
back of Mr. Tucker’s barn, where the matter
was discussed.</p>

<p>Some of the more excitable among them proposed
that, since the steamer on which Tim was
to leave would not touch at the island until nearly
six o’clock, there was plenty of time for him to
run away again, making it impossible for Mr.
Tucker to take him back. They argued that he
could build himself a hut in the woods, where,
protected by Tip, he could live the jolliest kind
of a life, and they could all come to see him, as
summer boarders.</p>

<p>But Tim rejected all such counsel, giving good
reason for doing so:</p>

<p>“Mr. Tucker says I ought not have run away
in the first place, and I s’pose he knows, though
it does seem hard to have to stay where folks are
so awful ugly to you. Now he says I must go
back, an’ I wouldn’t be any kind of a feller if I
run away from him after he’s been so good to me.
I’d like to go out in the woods to live, if it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
wouldn’t rain any, and I’d do anything rather
than go back to Selman; but Mr. Tucker says I
ought to go, an’ I’m goin’, whatever Captain
Babbige does to me.”</p>

<p>Every boy present knew that Tim was right,
and those who had first advised him felt ashamed
of having done so, while all united in cheering
him for his resolution, until Tip, awakened by
the noise, barked loudly, which to Tim’s mind
at least was proof that he approved of his master’s
decision.</p>

<p>That night Tim was escorted to the steamer
by a large number of boys, and while he was on
the wharf he felt reasonably brave, even though
he was obliged to pass directly in front of Captain
Pratt. But when the steamer left the dock,
and the cheers of the boys died away in the distance,
he fully expected to be summoned to the
wheel-house.</p>

<p>But Captain Pratt paid no attention to him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
and on the following day Selman was reached
without any incident worthy of mention.</p>

<p>There Tim was never exactly certain how the
matter was arranged. He knew that he was
taken into court almost as if he had been a criminal,
that many questions were asked him by the
judge, and that a number of gentlemen whom
he knew told of the ill-treatment he had received
from Captain Babbige.</p>

<p>Then it seemed as if Mr. Tucker had been
accused of something, for he told about his business
and himself, and showed a great number
of letters from people on Minchin’s Island, all
speaking of him as a kind and good man.</p>

<p>Captain Babbige was there, apparently in a
very uncomfortable frame of mind, and he spoke
to Tim in the kindest manner possible, asking
if he hadn’t always treated him as a son.</p>

<p>Tim was not sure how fathers did treat sons,
except in one or two cases; but he told the captain
of what he had said about wanting him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
to die, and then coaxed the judge—oh, so hard!—to
let him go back with Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>Then some other people had a good deal to say,
and the judge talked some more; after they were
all through Mr. Tucker told Tim it had been
decided he could go back to Minchin’s Island.</p>

<p>Tim’s delight was so great that it seemed impossible
for him to keep his feet on the ground,
and when he was back at the island again, in the
midst of the crowd of boys who had come to welcome
him for the second time, his joy found
vent in words.</p>

<p>And when Tim got into Mr. Tucker’s house,
where Bobby cheered until he was hoarse, and
Mrs. Tucker kissed him again and again, he
found it impossible even to speak, because of a
great lump in his throat, which was not caused
by sorrow; but he said over and over again to
himself that no one should regret in the man
what they had done for the homeless orphan boy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Troubles">TOM’S TROUBLES</h2>

<p class="noi author">BY JAMES OTIS</p>


<h3 class="nobreak" id="I">I.</h3>
</div>

<p class="cap">“It’s no use, boys; I can’t stand it any
longer”; and Tom Gibson leaned against
the fence in front of four of his most intimate
friends, assuming such an attitude as he believed
should be taken by a very badly abused
boy.</p>

<p>“What is it now?” asked little Dwight Holden,
in a very unsympathetic tone, much as if
he did not believe Tom’s troubles to be so very
severe.</p>

<p>“It’s the same thing every day till I’m all
worn out,” and Tom wiped his dry eyes with
his jacket-sleeve, more to show how heavy his
heart was than from any necessity. “I have to
’tend to that ugly baby every time when there’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
a good game of ball or I spy going on; an’ if
it does happen that I get out for a day’s fun, I
have to lug wood an’ water after I get home till
my arms are just ready to drop off. But I’m
through now an’ that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“What’ll you do?” and Kirk Masters continued
to eat a very small and very green apple
in a way that showed how much more intent
he was upon his limited feast than upon his
friend’s wrongs.</p>

<p>“I know what I <em>can</em> do,” said Tom, with a
shake of his head that was intended should convey
the idea of great mystery, and in this attempt
he was remarkably successful. His
friends had heard of his troubles before and
it was an old story, but the fact that he had
formed some plan which he intended should be
kept a secret was sufficient to arouse all their
curiosity. Dwight was as eager as he had been
apathetic, Kirk’s apple seemed suddenly to have
lost its flavor, and the entire group of boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
gathered around Tom very closely, as if fearful
lest they should lose some portion of the wonderful
secret they were certain he was about to
tell them.</p>

<p>“I am not sure that I dare to tell you,” said
Tom, in a mysterious whisper, and the boys
knew at once that he was ready to tell them all.
“You see, if my folks should know what I’m
going to do, that would spoil everything.”</p>

<p>“But what <em>are</em> you going to do?” persisted
Kirk, whose interest in his apple was now
wholly gone.</p>

<p>“Promise that you won’t ever tell.”</p>

<p>In an instant every boy had vowed that he
would keep the secret, and, after assuring himself
that there was no other person near who
might hear him, Tom began:</p>

<p>“I’m going to run away.”</p>

<p>The little circle of listeners gazed at the bold
boy in almost breathless astonishment, and Tom,
fully enjoying the sensation he had caused, continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
his story after first pausing sufficiently
long to note the effect which his announcement
had upon his hearers.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going, and you just better believe
that I’ll go so far away that nobody’ll ever find
me. I’ve stood this working around home just
as long as I can, and I’ll show my folks what
it is to treat a boy the way they’ve treated me.”</p>

<p>“But where are you going, Tom?”</p>

<p>“That part of it I’m not going to tell,” said
Tom, with a decided shake of the head, preferring
to seem cruel rather than confess that
he had no idea as to where he should go to escape
the tyranny of his parents. “I’ll leave here
some night, hide under the bridge at Rankin’s
brook till morning, and then go to some place
where none of the folks around here will ever
find me.”</p>

<p>“But what makes you hide under Rankin’s
bridge all night?” asked Dwight Holden, curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>“So’s I’ll be ready to start just as soon’s it’s
daylight, of course.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what you want to do that for,”
persisted Dwight. “You could sleep at home
all night and then start from there as early as
you wanted to. Nobody would think of stopping
you, for they’d believe you were just going
to the pasture.”</p>

<p>Tom was puzzled, just for an instant, as to
how he should answer the question, and then
realizing that it would never do for a boy who
was about to run away from home to confess
that he did not fully understand his own plans
he answered, with a great show of dignity:</p>

<p>“Don’t you bother. I think I know what I’m
about. I’ve got to sleep under Rankin’s bridge
the night I run away or else the thing wouldn’t
work.”</p>

<p>The vagueness of the plan gave it a greater
charm in the eyes of Tom’s friends. If it had
been a simple scheme of running away, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
they had understood it in all its details, it would
have seemed dull and commonplace compared
to what it was when it was so essential that Tom
should sleep under the bridge the night previous
to his leaving home forever.</p>

<p>Tom Gibson thoroughly enjoyed the sensation
he was causing, and was by no means disposed
to leave his friends before whom he was
posing as a hero. He did his best to be mysterious
both in speech and action, and would have
continued to throw out vague hints as to his
plans all the afternoon had not one of his oppressors—his
mother—called him into the
house to perform some one of the many tasks
which he believed was wearing his young life
away.</p>

<p>It is quite possible, if the whole truth could
be known, that Tom had not fully made up his
mind to run away from his comfortable home
when he first broached the subject to his friends;
but they had looked upon him as such a hero<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
from the first moment he mentioned it that he
decided it was necessary for him to go.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep on doing what she tells me to, so
that folks will see how hard I have to work,”
he muttered to himself as he left the boys and
went toward the house, “and then when I’m
off so far that nobody knows where I am mother’ll
be sorry she made me work so hard.”</p>

<p>As a matter of course, however, Tom’s
friends met him, after he had announced his
determination of leaving home, they made inquiries
as to the carrying out of his plan, and
this was so pleasant to the dissatisfied and
abused young man that he put off taking the
final step as long as possible. In fact, he delayed
so long that Dwight Holden plainly said
one day that he did not believe Tom had ever
intended to run away, but that he had said so
simply for the purpose of “making himself
look big.”</p>

<p>From that day he set about making his preparations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
for departure in earnest, telling his
friends that on the following Tuesday he would
disappear, never to be seen in Sedgwick again,
unless he should decide, many years later, to
come back as a wealthy gentleman, to see how
much the town had suffered by his absence.</p>

<p>Since he would be obliged to walk a good
portion of the distance to the place where his
fortune was to be made, he was forced to leave
out of the bundle he was making up many of
his valuables because of their size and weight.
A toy engine, a glass pen and holder, two rubber
balls, a large collection of marbles (agates and
alleys), a folding kite frame, three odd skates, a
lodestone, and two mouth harmonicas made up
the list of treasures that could be carried, and
these were carefully packed in an old army
blanket. He had saved cookies, gingerbread,
and choice pieces of pie until he had as much
as he believed would suffice as food for a week,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
and this he intended to carry in a paper parcel
in his hand.</p>

<p>Every arrangement had been made. The
day Tom had set for his departure came so
quickly that it seemed as if there must have
been some mistake in the almanac, and two or
three days had been lost. Tom met his friends,
acted the part of a hero before them until it
was so late that each one had been obliged to
go home, and then he, having bidden each one
in turn a solemn good-by, was compelled to
carry out the plan he had laid.</p>

<p>It is certain that at the moment his friends
left him Tom was thoroughly sorry he had ever
said anything about running away. He had
suddenly come to understand what it was to
be alone, and he by no means fancied the sensation.
At that moment his troubles which were
obliging him to leave home did not seem to be
nearly so great as they had been a few days
before; his home had never appeared so cheerful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
as now when he was leaving it, and he actually
began to hope that some insurmountable obstacle
would occur to prevent his running away.</p>

<p>The tears filled his eyes as he crept softly
up the back stairs, wishing so much that he
could kiss his mother and sister good-by, wishing
that he had never thought of going, but
fully believing that it would be unmanly not to
do so, and that his schoolmates would laugh at
him if he should abandon the scheme before he
had even attempted to carry it into execution.</p>

<p>He hoped the stairs would creak so loudly
that his mother would come to see what the
matter was and discover him leaving the house
with his bundles, but when he came down there
was hardly a sound. He was out of the house
without, apparently, having been discovered,
and his heart was very heavy as he walked
slowly around the yard to the gate, with a long,
lonely journey before him and with no idea as
to where would be the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>He had opened the gate and was taking a
farewell look at the house, when, to his great delight,
the front door was opened and he saw his
mother. He would surely be called back now,
he thought, and his friends could not accuse
him of having been afraid to carry out his plans.</p>

<p>“So you are really going to run away, are
you, Tommy?” said his mother, who did not
appear in the least surprised by his intended
departure.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” replied Tom, in a <em>very</em> low tone,
feeling foolish and at the same time wondering
whether his secret had been betrayed by his
friends.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Mrs. Gibson, speaking in
a matter-of-fact way and as if the subject was
an indifferent one to her, “if you feel that you
must go, I see no reason why you should not
have left the house in the daytime; but of course
you know best. I noticed that you did not pack
any of your clothes, so I put the most of them in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
this satchel, which I think you will find more
convenient than that bundle.”</p>

<p>Tom didn’t want to accept the satchel his
mother held out to him; but there seemed to be
no other course to pursue, and he took it, feeling
as he did so that if his mother had loved him
very dearly she would have boxed his ears
severely, ordering him at the same time to come
back into the house.</p>

<p>“Your father said he heard that Captain
Harrison was ready to sail, and knowing that
you have decided to sleep under Rankin’s bridge
we concluded that you were going with him,
since the vessel is in the river just below there.”</p>

<p>Tommy’s heart was so full that he could not
speak. Instead of being told to come into the
house and behave himself, as he would have
been only too glad to do, here was his mother
actually helping him to run away, and talking
as if she thought it was the best course he could
pursue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose you are in a hurry, Tommy,”
said Mrs. Gibson, kindly, “so I won’t detain
you. We shall be glad to see you if you should
conclude to come back here. Good-by. I hope
you will enjoy yourself better than you ever
could at home.”</p>

<p>The door was closed, and the almost broken-hearted
runaway could do no less than continue
his flight, out of which all the romance had
been taken.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak" id="II">II.</h3>

<p>As Tom walked from the house he was in a
very uncomfortable frame of mind. He felt
that his mother had been unkind in allowing
him to do as he had at first wanted to do, and
that if she had really loved him she would have
obliged him to come back. He felt as if he had
been wronged because he had not been punished
severely, and he was fully convinced that he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
made a mistake when he had decided that the
only thing he could do was to run away.</p>

<p>There was no possible excuse for him to return.
If his mother had not seen him, he believed
he would have sneaked back into the
house and have borne all the jeers of his schoolmates
because he had “backed out.” But he
decided that he could not even do that now, and
that it was absolutely necessary for him to go
on as he had begun.</p>

<p>“How I wish I hadn’t started!” he said to
himself as he trudged along toward Rankin’s
brook, his bundles growing heavier each moment.
“She told me about Captain Harrison’s
going away to-morrow, so that I could go with
him and that she’d know where I was. But I
won’t do anything like that. I’ll go ’way off
where she won’t ever see me again, and then
she’ll be sorry she was so willing to let me run
away.”</p>

<p>Tommy was being severely punished for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
wanting to leave his home and he knew it, but
he had not suffered enough to cause him to be
willing to admit his fault and to ask his mother
to forgive him; therefore the discouraged runaway
very unwillingly continued his decidedly
desolate course.</p>

<p>By some singular chance he met no one on his
way. If he could have done so he felt that he
might in some slight degree revenge himself, for
he would have sent word to his mother that he
did not intend to go with Captain Harrison and
that she should never hear from him again.</p>

<p>But he did not meet any one from the time
he left his home until he arrived at the bridge,
and then he realized that if the scheme had not
been entirely a success neither had the details
been perfect. To sleep under Rankin’s bridge,
when he thought of it in the daytime, and with
his schoolmates around him, was nothing more
than a pleasant little adventure; but when it
came to carrying the plan into execution it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
quite a different matter. The night was dark;
the brook gurgled and sang in a most ghostly
fashion; the air under the stone arches felt
damp; and he could find no place where he
could lie down with any prospect of comfort.</p>

<p>“It’s no use. I can’t fix any kind of a bed
here, so I’ve got to sit up all night—that’s all
there is to it.”</p>

<p>Tom was reckless by this time, and without
any care as to a selection of the spot where he
was to spend the night he sat down in about as
uncomfortable a place as he could have found,
confident that the time would seem very short.</p>

<p>He tried to make up his mind as to where he
would go when the morning should come; then
he felt about for a softer seat, very nearly falling
into the water in the attempt. He thought
of his mother’s sorrow, which was to be his revenge,
and then again he changed his position.
He wondered if his schoolmates were snugly
tucked up in bed asleep; and then he began to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
doze, leaning his head against the granite sides
of the arch.</p>

<p>Suddenly he awoke with a start that gave
him a very uncomfortable twinge in his neck,
while every portion of his body was stiff and
lame. He thought that he had slept a long
time, and he looked out from under the bridge,
fully expecting to see the sun. It was as dark
as when he first sought this very uncomfortable
sleeping-place.</p>

<p>“The sun hasn’t come up,” he said as he settled
back on the rock in a very awkward manner, as
if it hurt him to move around much; “but I
know it must be morning, because I feel as if
I’d been asleep ten or twelve hours. I’ll start
up the road a little.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment the village clock began
to strike and Tom counted:</p>

<p>“One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, <em>eleven</em>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>Only eleven o’clock, and he had thought it was
time for the sun to rise!</p>

<p>Tom tried to lie down first in one place and
then in another, but the sharp-pointed rocks
prevented him from assuming anything like a
reclining position. Then he thought of his own
nice bed; but he knew he could not enjoy it, at
least not without too great a sacrifice of manly
dignity.</p>

<p>He thought of Captain Harrison’s schooner,
which was to sail on the following morning.
He might go on board of her; but if he should
do so, how could he revenge himself on his
mother?</p>

<p>“I can’t stay here all night if it’s going to
last as long as this hour has. I don’t want to
walk up the road, because I can’t see where I’m
going. Mother won’t know for certain that I’ve
gone on the <i>Swiftsure</i>, and she’ll feel bad
enough to-morrow morning when I don’t come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
home to breakfast, so I’ll go on board where
I can get some sleep.”</p>

<p>Tom knew exactly where the clumsy old
schooner was moored, for many a time had he
and his friends been up to look at her when she
was in port and laughed at the name of <i>Swiftsure</i>,
which it seemed must have been painted
on her stern in mockery.</p>

<p>With his bundles in his hands he stumbled
down through the pasture, following the course
of the brook, until he arrived at a little stone
pier, at the head of which could be seen the old
schooner which had been made ready for a fishing
cruise down the coast.</p>

<p>Tom scrambled on board as softly as was possible
in the darkness; but he might have saved
himself the trouble of taking precautions to
prevent any one from hearing him, for the old
schooner was deserted and looked quite as lonesome
as <em>he</em> felt. The cabin-doors were locked,
the hatches were fastened down too securely for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
him to raise them unaided, and it seemed very
much as if even the <i>Swiftsure</i> denied him the
shelter he so sadly needed.</p>

<p>On the deck lay an upturned dory. He might
crawl under that, and although it would be but
poor shelter it was surely better than trying to
lie on the sharp rocks under the bridge. Tom
was not nearly as particular where he slept as
he would have been at home, and he counted
himself very fortunate in finding under the boat
a quantity of old nets that made him quite a soft
bed, so soft, in fact, that he was asleep in less
than five minutes after he had found shelter.</p>

<p>Everything had contributed to make Tom
very tired on the day when he ran away, and he
slept on the fishing-nets quite as soundly as if
he had been at home. He did not even hear
Captain Harrison and his crew when they came
on board at a very early hour in the morning.
The bustle and confusion attendant upon getting
the <i>Swiftsure</i> under way failed to awaken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
him. When, however, the <i>Swiftsure</i> was on the
open sea, tumbling about on the waves in her
own clumsy fashion, he came to understand
where he was, and he gained this information
in quite a sensational manner.</p>

<p>Shortly after the old schooner had left the
dock the wind freshened until it was blowing
quite half a gale, and Captain Harrison began
to fear that the crazy old sails would be blown
away. In order to prevent such a catastrophe,
the schooner was hove to and all hands set to
work reefing sail.</p>

<p>As a matter of course the clumsy old <i>Swiftsure</i>
was wallowing in the trough of the sea,
tossing and tumbling about in a most provoking
manner. Captain Harrison was helping his
crew of fishermen “shorten” the foresail,
when, just as all hands were standing amidships
trying to reef without pulling the very
reef-points out of the decayed canvas, a queer-looking
bundle rolled from under the dory,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
capsizing one or two of the sailors as it struck
them and then rolling into the lee scuppers,
where it lay uttering cries of pain.</p>

<p>The crew were absolutely frightened, first at
seeing this queer-looking parcel and then at
hearing it make a noise, while those who had
been knocked down actually fled forward in
alarm. Captain Harrison started aft, but on
looking back he stopped short, gazed for an instant,
first at the dory and then at the bundle
in the scuppers, and said as he gave his hat a
forcible blow, as if to prevent it from flying off
his head in surprise, “I’m blowed if it ain’t
a boy!”</p>

<p>Tom looked up as if amazed that he should
have been mistaken for other than what he was,
and then the rolling of the vessel threw him
back again toward the dory, tossing him from
one side to the other much as if he had been
a rubber ball.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” roared Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
Harrison, angry now because he had shown
what looked to be fear.</p>

<p>“He come out of the dory,” replied one of the
men, for Tom was too much engaged in rolling
about the deck to be able to make any reply.</p>

<p>It was impossible for all hands to stand staring
at Tom when the foresail needed immediate
attention, and the sick runaway was allowed to
roll up and down the deck at his own sweet will,
or, rather, at the will of the wind, until the
<i>Swiftsure</i> was on her course again with reduced
canvas. Then Captain Harrison shouted,
“Somebody catch that boy before he breaks himself
all to pieces and bring him aft here to me.”</p>

<p>In a few moments, but not without considerable
difficulty, the captain’s orders were
obeyed, and Tom, looking pale and thoroughly
wretched, was held up in front of the <i>Swiftsure’s</i>
commander.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re Tom Gibson!” exclaimed that
gentleman, in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>Tom nodded his head; he could not trust himself
to speak.</p>

<p>“How came you on board? Been running
away, eh?”</p>

<p>Again Tom nodded his head, and Captain
Harrison began to understand that his passenger
was in no mood for conversation.</p>

<p>“Take him below; I’ll dress him down after
he gets a little better.”</p>

<p>Tom was led below into a cabin that smelled
like fish, oil, stale vegetables, and, in fact, everything
that is disagreeable. And there, amid
this combination of terrible odors, poor, sick,
runaway Tom could hear the creaking and
grinding of the timbers of the crazy old hulk,
while all he could do was to moan and groan
in unison.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak" id="III">III.</h3>

<p>If at any time during the twenty-four hours
following Tom Gibson’s appearance among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
startled crew of the <i>Swiftsure</i> that young gentleman
had been asked if the old schooner was in
any danger, he would have answered that she
would surely sink within an hour and that all
on board would perish with her.</p>

<p>No one asked Tom such a question; but he
fully believed that it was impossible for the old
craft to live much longer in the gale, and although
he knew he was in even a more dangerous
position than any one else, owing to the fact
that he was below, he felt so sick that he paid
but little attention to the supposed danger.</p>

<p>At the end of twenty-four hours, however,
matters presented a decidedly different appearance.
The wind having subsided, the clumsy
old schooner no longer tumbled and tossed
about; the sun was shining brightly, and, what
was of more importance to Tom, he had so
nearly recovered from his illness as to have
eaten a very hearty breakfast in spite of the mixture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
of bad odors that had been so disagreeable
to him.</p>

<p>Tom went on deck, almost enjoying the motion
of the vessel which, a few hours before,
had been so uncomfortable, and was beginning
to think that there was some pleasure to be had
by running away, when Captain Harrison said,
in anything but a pleasant tone of voice:</p>

<p>“Well, Tom, you’ve come on board my vessel
and eaten my food without so much as asking
my permission, so now s’posin’ me an’ you have
some kind of a settlement.”</p>

<p>Poor Tom! All idea of enjoyment vanished
at once, and again he understood that the boy
who runs away is obliged to pay a very high
price for what is a continual pain, rather than
a pleasure.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you say something?” demanded
Captain Harrison. “Do you think I keep this
schooner jest to accommodate boys who want
to run away from home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir,” faltered Tom; “but I don’t know
what to say, because, you see, I don’t know how
we can have a settlement, unless you should take
the things I brought on board to pay you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen what you brought with you,”
thundered Captain Harrison, acting as if he
was very angry, although if any one had been
observing him closely a twinkle of mirth could
have been seen in his eyes. “All the traps
you’ve got wouldn’t pay for your breakfast.
Now listen to me and take care that you don’t
forget what I say. You’ve seen fit to come
aboard this schooner, which is bound on a fishing
cruise, consequently you’ve got to pay my
price for your fun. You’ll have to do your
share of the work without grumbling, and I tell
you candidly that it’ll be more than you ever
dreamed of, coddled by your mother as you have
been.”</p>

<p>It was pretty hard for a boy who had run
away from home because he had been obliged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
to work too hard to be told that he would have
so much to do that what he had been obliged to
submit to at home was hardly more than petting.
But he <em>had</em> run away, and he was obliged to
pay the price. He did not even dare to offer
any objections, for he understood only too well
that he was in the captain’s power.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go to work?” shouted Captain
Harrison, after he had given Tom plenty
of time in which to think the matter over.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p>“Go forward and you’ll soon find plenty to
keep you out of mischief.”</p>

<p>Tom did as he was directed, and he learned
that the captain had said no more than was
strictly true. Every one on board appeared to
think that he had a perfect right to set a task
for the stowaway and there was no hesitation
about doing so. If the cook wanted wood split,
the pots and pans scoured, vegetables pared, or
any other disagreeable work done Tom was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
called upon, and he soon learned that it was
dangerous to refuse. If any of the crew wanted
an assistant at any time or on any piece of work,
Tom was that assistant, and at the slightest hesitation
a blow was given to remind him that in no
sense was he his own master. He was the boy-of-all-work
and with no opportunity to play.</p>

<p>Compared with his condition on the <i>Swiftsure</i>,
Tom had lived a life of luxurious ease at
home, and there was hardly a moment, when he
was awake, during which he did not regret that
he had ever been so foolish as to run away.</p>

<p>Before the fishing-grounds were reached the
<i>Swiftsure</i> put into a harbor for supplies, and
there Tom decided upon a bold step. He asked
one of the men who had treated him with more
consideration than the others had done to lend
him two cents with which to buy a postage
stamp, and on a dirty piece of paper he wrote
the following letter to his mother:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mama</span>,—I was wicked to want to run away, and
I want to come back terribly. If I had any money I would
try to get back from here; but I haven’t, so I shall have to
stay till this old vessel comes home. You’ll let me come,
won’t you, mother? I won’t say a word, no matter how hard
you whip me for running away, and I won’t ever grumble
when you want me to do anything. My hands are all covered
with blisters; but they don’t begin to be as sore as my
heart is when I have to get into these dirty berths at night,
knowing that I can’t even speak to you. Don’t be angry with
me any more, but <em>please</em> let me in when I come home.</p>

<p class="noic">“Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Thomas Gibson</span>.”<br></p>
</div>

<p>Captain Harrison, who had seen Tom writing,
and who suspected at once to whom the
letter was to be sent, gave the boy an envelope
and allowed him to go on shore in order to
mail it.</p>

<p>Tom felt better after this, even though his
condition was in no wise improved. His mother
would know that he was sorry for what he had
done, and even though but a short time before
he had looked upon her as a hard-hearted parent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
it seemed as if her forgiveness was the one
thing he wanted above all others.</p>

<p>If, during the voyage to the fishing-grounds,
Tom thought he had worked as hard as was possible,
he learned that he had been mistaken
when the real labor of the cruise was commenced.
All day he was obliged to fish with
twenty or thirty fathoms of line, to which was
attached a heavy sinker of lead that required
nearly all his strength to pull up, and when the
catch had been large he was compelled to remain
up half the night helping the men dress
the fish. His hands, which had been covered
with blisters, as he wrote his mother, were cut
and bleeding, while many times the pain was so
great that he could not go to sleep even when
he had the opportunity.</p>

<p>In this work Tom could not say that he was
obliged to do more than any one else; all hands
worked to the best of their ability, and it but
serves to show that Tom was getting to be quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
a sensible boy when it is said that he felt he
was doing no more than was right under the
circumstances. But nevertheless his heart was
quite as sore and his homesickness as severe
as when he wrote the letter to his mother. The
only time when he was in the slightest degree
contented was when he was fishing. He knew
that the sooner the old schooner was loaded,
the sooner would she be headed toward home,
and he counted each fish he caught as another
step toward his getting home to Sedgwick and
to mother.</p>

<p>The time finally came, six weeks after Tom
had started to pass the night under Rankin’s
bridge, when Captain Harrison said:</p>

<p>“We won’t ‘dress down’ to-night, boys; but
try to carry back fresh what we catch to-day.”</p>

<p>“What does he mean by that?” Tom asked
of one of the crew.</p>

<p>“It means that we shall start for home after
the fish are done biting to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>Tom could hardly realize his good-fortune,
and he worked in a dazed sort of way, but kept
repeating to himself each moment: “I’m going
home, I’m going home. And what’s better, I’ll
stay when I get there.”</p>

<p>At an early hour that afternoon the bow of
the old <i>Swiftsure</i> was turned toward Sedgwick,
and as she rose and fell heavily on the waves,
sending clouds of spray fore and aft, Tom could
hardly refrain from giving vent to his joy by
at least three hearty cheers.</p>

<p>The trip home was by no means as speedy
as Tom could have desired. It seemed to him
as if the old vessel was sailing more slowly than
she had ever sailed before and as if the winds
were really trying to delay him.</p>

<p>Then came the day when he could see the
spire of the church in Sedgwick, and just at the
time when he knew that his father and mother
were sitting down to supper Tom leaped on
shore. He waited for nothing, but ran home at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
full speed, and it was not until he had kissed
his mother and father again and again and
heard them assure him of their forgiveness that
he could breathe freely.</p>

<p>As may be expected, Tom had not been home
more than an hour before the friends to whom
he had confided his purpose of running away
called to see him and to learn how much of his
fortune he had made.</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is, fellows,” he said, in
reply to their questions. “I’m not as big a fool
as I was before I ran away. I thought I was
having a mighty hard time of it here, but I
soon found out my mistake. All I can say is
that I pity fellows that haven’t got any homes
to go to when they get as homesick as I was.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t think of running away
again very soon?” suggested Dwight Holden,
laughingly.</p>

<p>“Boys,”—and Tom spoke very solemnly now—“when
I was on the <i>Swiftsure</i> I found out how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
lonesome a boy can be without his mother; I
never knew before. Just as long as I can I shall
stay where I can see my mother and speak to
her; and if at any time any one of you thinks
that his mother isn’t the best and dearest friend
a boy can have, just do as I did and it won’t
take you very long to find out that you are
mistaken.”</p>
